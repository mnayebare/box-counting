---

According to new research, deep learning models based on artificial intelligence can identify someone's race merely by looking at their X-rays, which would be impossible for a human doctor looking at the same photos.  
  
The findings raise several serious concerns concerning AI's role in medical diagnosis, assessment, and treatment: Could computer algorithms mistakenly apply racial bias when analysing photographs like these?

1. Training data: If the data an algorithm is analyzing is of a fundamentally different type than the data it was trained on, it's prone to failure. When analyzing data specific to one demographic group, the algorithm should be trained specifically to analyze data from that group.

2. Diagnosis based on demographic instead of symptoms/physical condition: If one demographic has a higher prevalence of a condition, you want to control for that in a diagnostic algorithm. To use a rudimentary example, it's not helpful to me for an algorithm to say ""you're at 50% greater risk for testicular cancer"" just because the algorithm notices I have testicles, which half of the training data subjects didn't.

Black/minority patients were less likely to spend money on future healthcare, perhaps due to being unable to afford care or from having negative experiences. The issue is that the AI had been trained to use healthcare SPENDING as a way to measure health. More spending in the AI mind meant worse health. Wealthy white patients spent more money on healthcare, so the AI judged them to be unhealthier and therefore allocated more intense treatment to them. Minority patients avoided future healthcare spending, so the AI thought that meant they were healthier. The AI was using race as a health predictor without understanding the socioeconomic context. Essentially, the program had been taught using biases data so it made biased decision. Learning algorithms make predictions based on data, but they don’t “understand” the data or it’s meaning.

You can design race-ignorant formulas and algorithms that end up utterly racist. It's happened before, and can be done both by accident and design. 

Your local neighborhood home prices and crime rates are both positively correlated to race, so if a bank uses these in deciding to give you a home loan, which sounds superficially very reasonable, they are generating racial discrimination on the fly. Your race can't get loans and can't get to better statistics as a result and so continue to be denied loans. 

Whether your parents have a college degree is correlated to race. So if a bank is deciding to give you a student loan, and they use your parent's education as a factor, say as an indicator of ability to complete the school, then once again: racial discrimination is now implicit in this act.

So in this case imagine your health insurance is tied to your current health.

I think the thing that's making students pull back from your question is that there's growing conversation about how even 'positive' examples of racial bias can end up being a double-edged sword. 

For example - A university preferring asian candidates due to a perception that asian kids make for better students would be considered a positive bias. It means more asian kids will get into the school they applied to, right? But it will also end up feeding into the 'model minority' stereotypes - The school faculty and staff might be inclined to view an asian student who isn't doing well in their classes as someone who is 'clearly capable of more' and 'just being lazy', even if the real problem is that they're dealing with an unchecked learning disability or mental health issue that's impairing their performance. The school might be less willing to reach out with resources to assist, preferring to spend those resources on the students who 'really need them' instead, and suddenly the 'positive' racial bias is looking a lot like racism.",3

In theory analysing stuff with an AI sounds great as an AI is perfectly neutral. For an AI everything is just data there is no difference at all. However in reality AIs are sort of like small children.  
If you teach them the wrong thing they are going to replicate it without any selfreflection.  


If an AI is able to detect the race it suddenly changes the dataset for its analysis. And these datasets are not unbiased. In a world where we humans created totally neutral datasets nothing of that would be an issue but we do not have such datasets. Diseases occuring more often in one group than in the other are a good example for this. If such a disease occurs often for one group we probably have a lot of data on it for said group with a realistic chance of representation.  
However for another group te data can be totally off just because we usually do not test them for this disease. They have it in a much higher number than anticipated we just do not know of it since we do not test people outside of a group that is more vulnerable to it.

If the dataset you train it on is a bunch of disease diagnoses, and doctors are less likely to correctly identify the disease for black people (due to complex socioeconomics, such as black people on average being poorer and thus can afford less second opinions etc), then the AI will learn that it should misdiagnose black people.

Oftentimes, it seems that a certain disease is more prevalent among a certain race, but that’s actually more likely attributed to residential/work conditions or socioeconomic status. For example, a Black person who has a solidly upper-middle class family history and works a desk job will have a super different health profile than a Black person who has a family history of generational poverty, low access to nutritional food, and works a factory job. They’re both “black” but in this case, that means absolutely nothing.

The other issue with race in medicine is that it’s literally a socially constructed and self identified category. Besides the fact that you cannot determine someone’s race from their genome, we’d call an African American whose family has been in America for centuries “Black ” We’d also call someone who currently lives in Africa “Black.” The diseases that are popularly considered to occur more in specific races (like sickle cell) will have greatly different prevalence in both of these populations. Race as a category is still flawed. 

Of course, we still use it in medicine, because race is sometimes a mediocre proxy for a lot of factors, but there’s a case to be made for its use and it’s disuse.

So racial bias in AI really wouldn't ever be helpful in a medical setting. At least least, there's no reason that I can think of.

When you hear about stuff like ""African Americans are more prone to heart attacks,"" that's pretty much always due to a multitude of things like the average diet and living condition of African Americans, not just because African Americans are more prone to heart attacks as a race.

There is some research that suggests some genetic variations have allowed certain groups to be afflicted with a particular condition or disease more often, or resist a particular condition/disease better (malaria and sickle cell anemia being a key example of both), but it's again mostly because of genetic variance rather the differences between actual species, which tend to be far more stark.",2

Machine learning amplifies an existing bias. That is, features from underrepresented groups can be ignored or misclassified. If a model can detect race, it can use it as a feature. But if that feature has low representation, your model might be less accurate. You can definitely model them better with better sampling to make sure your data is diverse.

I believe the point is *we didn't know* that x-rays can be predictors for race, so perhaps not all the samples were properly stratified to ensure a model that works with everyone. Now that the computer figured it out and can introduce ""race"" as a feature. We probably should go back and check out our samples to see if we have enough data. We probably should check this with other publications too.

Then we need to think about what other features other than race do play a role and became hidden features of the model. Do we have a good samples from other groups for each of these things?

The result of this is things like the fact that it is taboo to point out that that [(predominantly white) European-descended populations have something of a resistance to HIV, apparently the result of the Black Plague.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16880184/)

post50con,controversial,1.6001453961458911,highest,"All people have the same basic skeletons, but the proportions can vary in different people around the globe. For example the width of your nose compared to the size of your skull, or the size/shape of your teeth, or how broad your tibia are compared to their width, that sort of thing. So from this, we can take an educated guess where someone (or their ancestors) might be from based on the proportions of their skeletons. Since the geographical origins of your ancestors broadly correlate with race, it's therefore possible to estimate race based on someone's bone structure. 


Thats the thory, but reality is a lot more messy. While it is true that on average, a person from region A will have certain differences compared to a person from region B, that does not necessarily mean that a specific individual from region A will be different from a specific individual from region B. For example, on average, the corners of the jaw are sharper in Asian people than in Europeans. But if I were to measure my co-workers, Jiayan might actually have a more rounded jaw then Helga, because Jiayan has a rounder jaw than the average for China, and Helga has a sharper one than average for Germany. So whenever we guess where someone is from based on skeletal features, it's more of a probability than an exact pinpoint. You could guess the Helga is more likely to be European than African or South American, but you couldn't say ""this one's certainly from Germany"". On top of that, you also have to consider that someone may have ancestors from very different places. Maybe the reason Jiayan has a rounder jaw than most Chinese people is because her grandfather was from India. You can see how it's very easy for this technique to label mixed-race people as whatever race best fits their proportions, even though it might not fit how they would identify themselves. The fact that race doesn't always fit geographical origins makes this even harder. 

Tldr: yes, the proportions of certain bones in the body do vary with geographic origin and can therefore be used to guess someone's race naesd on their skeleton, but its not an exact science and has important limitations.",3

post50con,controversial,1.6001453961458911,highest,"Not really... This is called ""morphology"" and ""anthropometric measurement"".  Here's the [wiki on morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)). And here is the [wiki for anthropometric measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry). Both are totally valid practices in biological sciences. As examples, here is a [quick paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16077306/) on the topic, and [here's another](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726000/).

TLDR: Morphology is the use of appearance and measurements to categorize organisms.

In this case, specifically, /u/MaybeTheDoctor refers to the subset of morphology that is called ""craniology"". [Craniology is different from phrenology](https://sciencing.com/the-difference-between-craniology-phrenology-12759816.html).

TLDR: Morphology is a *scientific* practice of categorizing organisms through measurable traits, based on well designed statistical analyses. Craniology is the application of this method to any vertebrate organism's skull's properties. Phrenology is the *non scientific* practice that attempts to use skull measurements and anomalies to draw conclusions specifically about human beings' personal traits. 

Saying one group has skulls with a certain trait and another group has skulls with another trait can be valid, depending on the statistical evidence backing this claim. Saying one is intelligent and another is not based on the presence or absence of a random bump is not valid.

With that said, craniology has generally fallen out of favor among most western anthropologists over the last half century, because of its understandably uncomfortable closeness to phrenology and the difficulty in deriving any scientifically useful findings from it. However, due to cultural and academic isolation from the west, anthropologists from ex-Soviet nations still carry out studies on this topic. Try searching on google scholar if interested - if you look at the ""cited by"" links for these studies, you'll find that they're not particularly disputed, but they're also not cited much at all, which goes to show that they're not really pushing science forward very much either.

With that also said... Morphology and craniology are widely employed in paleoanthropology, as these are pretty much the only tools available for identifying and categorizing early homonid remains (see figure 2 in this [link](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/overview-of-hominin-evolution-89010983/)). These methods are also use pretty extensively within medical sciences, where morphology can be used to assist in the diagnosis of illnesses.",4

The problem with the concept of ""race"" is that the divisions that each country concocts are not based off of biological factors. They are always based off of social factors and phenotypical factors. Biological factors exist in humans and different villages and ethnicities, but there aren't any large sets of biological factors that correlate with the American classifications of race.

Certainly if you compare African Americans and Caucasoid American bone structure, you're going to find general patterns among them... but that's just because most White Americans are Western European and most Black Americans are Coastal-West African. What if you compared Kho-San people with Greek people with Dinka people with Irish people?

And that's why ""race"" is still a useless factor in medical science. Being ""White"" or ""Black"" is meaningless and tells you nothing.

Conventional geographic ""racial"" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes.""[13] While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color,[14] the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups – meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a ""pure"" ancestry as obsolete.[11] Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. **As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society.[15]**

Now here's the thing to understand, it isn't ""being black"" that makes them likely to have sickle cell. The melanin content of their skin isn't a risk factor. But for the reasons I just explained a person of African decent is statistically more likely to suffer from that particular genetic condition due to long term social reasons. If we start mixing black and white ans brown and whatever color people freely eventually the disease would become equally prevalent along all the ""races"".

In the meantime though, it's probably wise for doctors to keep in mind that for certain patients be more on the lookout for certain symptoms. We don't want to screw up getting someone proper care trying to be ""color blind"" or whatever.",3

As a medical anthropologist who studies culture and how it intersects with medicine. 1) there is no such thing as biological race and I definitely think this would further biases in medicine that already exist. 2) There definitely is a predisposition for certain health issues in certain ethnicities. That being said, you have to look at the social determinants of health of these groups. Do these people have access to safe place to exercise? Can they walk in their neighborhood? Do they have access to fresh foods at a reasonable price? Do they live in an area with clean water and air? Can they access medical care for prevention rather than reaction? 
Doctors still show medical biases to women and BIPOC persons. Racism causes health problems of its own. Doctors ignore symptoms, misdiagnose with a lack of care, and a study done showed that a large portion of medical students surveyed still perceived a difference in level of pain felt and that these persons have higher pain tolerances. This leads to a lack of pain meds and the chance the doctor with think the patient is “acting”.

I almost agree, except what we call race has so much social baggage that trying to tie to biology in any rigorous manner is a futile effort. Race as a concept has a social origin and serves a social need. Yeah  we use it as a proxy for heritable traits (or what I call ancestry).

In a certain neighbourhood, when someone shoplifts, the police are more likely to let them off with a warning if they’re white and more likely to arrest them if they’re black. Since the people who are let off with a warning aren’t recorded as committing the crime, the computer displays this as black people committing the crime more, because all it has is the arrest records.

The data from the neighbourhood, along with data from many others, is fed into an algorithm. Algorithms can be used for really important things, like whether someone gets parole. The AI decides a certain person is more likely to shoplift because it was fed data that said that. Now black people whose cases are seen by that AI are less likely to get parole/rated as a higher risk for recidivism.

So some are denied parole because of past charges they personally have (whether or not those charges were justified) and some are denied because of the bias in the algorithm, and they’ll never know.

I’m happy to give more info about algorithms, but not in the mood to get into an argument about whether or not racism exists in the legal system.

post50con,controversial,1.6001453961458911,highest,"> My understanding is that most biological attempts at classifying races have been debunked and our species has no race boundaries:

That's a line of propaganda from the ""there is no race"" crowd.   We're all humans and we're all African if you go back far enough.  Specifically 80,000 years according to all the genetic marker tracing we've found that has really confirmed the [Out of Africa Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans).  For ~100,000 years the relative isolation between pockets of humanity has lead to genetic drift and allowed locals to adapt to their environment. The most obvious being how much vitamin D they need from the [average sunlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/44y90h/annual_sunshine_hours_map_of_the_world_2753_1400/) of an area. As humanity spread around the globe they picked up mutations and passed them on and we can very clearly see how these things have spread around.   You can pick literally section of the [tree of life](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology\)) and group all the descendents together. This doesn't magically stop at humanity. (Although sexual recombination does blend branches together. Mixed races are more than possible and often healthier. Remember, inbreed for ~~freaks~~ interesting features, outbreed for health).  

>Also,what is the race of the increasing number of people of mixed origins? 

Both. Technically it's not an even 50/50 split as you get a random shuffle of genes from mom and dad. But it probably averages out to something pretty close.  You're a mix of everything up in that tree. For [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain), it should have been mixed a little more. [Much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug).

>Or people who live in in historical crossroads?

Everywhere is a crossroads to somewhere. There's really no group of people living at a dead-end. And everyone is closer related to their ancestral neighbors that to groups from the other side of the world. 

But come on. Why push an agenda like this? What's the benefit and for who?  Do people from Japan look different from people from Sudan, on average? Yeah? We know why.     Now, just because we've been able to identify what these concepts out of antiquity really are, it doesn't mean everything the ancients thought about lightning, alchemy, or race is 100% correct.    While ""Asian"" typically doesn't include people from Moscow or Bombay or Mecca (despite being in Asia), the term ""black"" as a stand-in for ""African"" really misses the mark. In the USA ""Black"" is synonymous with south-west African. But they could be more distantly related to a S.African than to someone from China.

These adaptations also reflect very specific genetic and biological markers for very specific diseases and ailments. So it stands to reason perfectly well that this level of specificity matters, even if we don't feel comfortable with it.

Keep in mind that the relative quick changes in modern society, the last 2000 years or so, don't compare to last 200,000 years of environmental and climatological adaptation. Our bodies have had a very long time to adapt to specific conditions, and an even longer time for those adaptations to take root in our physical structure. That history matters to medical diagnosis.

If people are concerned that an AI may do something with this information, why? There has to be a specific reason to be biased in the same way humans are in order to do so.

They keep calling it ""AI"", but it's actually Machine Learning. What it outputs heavily depends on what's it trained with and what goals it's supposed to achieve with said training, which can result in extremely flawed results that [we have no idea how it came up with](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0048-x), but look great at first sight.

Case in point; A ML could also give ""high precision"" results in [craniometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniometry) when it's trained with data and goals to do so. But jumping from that to ""It's evidence for biologically distinct human races!"" is quite the leap, as that outcome was already predetermined by the training and task given in the very first place.",1

As an example of potential bias in the training set, if the ""African"" label training set was heavily drawn from hospitals with older, lower resolution imagers perhaps the AI associates low-resolution images with the ""African"" label. Remember that one of the claims in the article is that they used images which had none of the clues that humans usually look for, so we have to figure out what clues the AI found.

The concern expressed in the article is that the system cannot explain what it found.

At some point the diagnosis software needs to be able to explain why it makes a decision so that the humans relying on it can determine if the AI is missing something obvious from its training set.

Look at dogs and their vastly different shape and sizes, there we can identify different races; humans by contrast aren't that much different.

But the averages of those genes were observable - just like how you don't have to catalogue every passing photon to make a judgement on whether one light source is brighter than another.

The observable characteristics associated with each race correlate with other characteristics, so while physical appearance does not purely dictate any other characteristic like propensity for a particular genetic disorder, it is a statistical fact that it indicates non-appearance traits.

The scientists get a bunch of x-rays and sort them into multiple piles. In this case, they sort them into piles based on self-reported race of the participants.

But they could also try to sort them into piles based on whether someone likes pineapple on pizza, or shoe size or how much they like watching Tom & Jerry. Or completely at random.

Then you feed the computer with those examples and try to make it predict the pile from the x-ray.

The computer doesn't care about the ethics of your sorting into piles, or whether it's subjective or objective etc. Only about whether it's predictable.

After you are done training the computer, you give it a few examples it hasn't seen, and check its predictions on those against the what piles it's in. That's your validation to see how well the computer has learned to generalise and predict.

The computer doesn't learn anything fundamental or objective about 'race' here. It only learns to predict human judgement.

Not all ways to sort into piles are predictable. Eg if you put your x-rays into truly random piles, the computer won't be able to categorise x-rays it hasn't seen before.

That's not what ""race"" is.  Race has no biological definition.  It's not even a concept in biology the way it's used here.  Race is %100 social, based on loosely on what people *believe to be attributed to regions*.  Which also isn't really true, considering ""white"" could be Spanish all the way to Eastern Russia, up to Sweden, and back down to Greece.  Although, many would argue that the Mediterranean countries aren't ""white"" and that Spaniards aren't white.  

It doesn't stop there, though.  In a lot of Latin America, there are almost limitless races based on the race of all of your grandparents.  In the US, you're black if you look black.  You could have 3 white grandparents but one black and you are black. Now, that has absolutely nothing to do with geography or specifically what part of the world *you* came from.

I’m not saying that these predictions are ethical right but they can often be observed in clinic whether they’re “used” or not

It’s almost a question not so much of the ability to do this but of not having AI repeat the ethical issues around around the affects of race and medicine and the associations are made there in and of course since is ai it would be on a much more devastating scale especially because of the place that ai holds in society Etc",1

These averages are done using a certain x-ray technique called Bone Mineral Density scans, using the same settings and comparing the readouts to a baseline of other scans.

This baseline is determined by a sample of similar subjects (100 Caucasian people of good health, for example) so the latest scan of a single person can be used and be compared.

This data has been around for decades, with rudimentary programs running these comparisons to help determine if someone is developing osteoporosis or similar degenerative disorders.

It isn't surprising to me that AI is capable of going the next step based on a traditional x-ray, since there are very small differences between a person's skeleton based on their race/sex/inherited health.

What has been lost in this equation is what Richard Weaver called ""Fraternity"" our commitment to our whole human family in love and duty regardless of any assumption of equality (e.g., a young child is inferior in wisdom to the parent, which is why a parent has duties, but all are love, all are human, and all are helped). What makes you worthy of human dignity is the fact that you are a human being and not that you're IQ meets a certain standard or that you are physically capable or that you are beautiful.

Also, people saying that “some diseases occur more in some races” are also missing a potential issue. these diseases might actually be more prevalent in some races because of genetic heritage/other factors OR possibly because of incomplete data/racial biases in diagnosis (e.g. underdiagnosis of a certain disease in certain race(s)) and building your diagnostic AI around that assumption would only exacerbate the problem.

post50con,controversial,1.6001453961458911,highest,"Racism, sexism, and more are absolutely a concern for AI in medical imaging as they perpetuate the biases of the data they were trained on, which reflects social inequalities in society. The problem is that race is socially constructed, as there is no genetic test to determine a person’s race. However, there are differences in things like bone geometry^1, which will obviously show up in an x-ray. This isn’t an issue per se, as long as the AI used is something like an unsupervised or weakly-supervised computer vision model that identifies unique features and then classifies them based on the combinations of those features.

The issue here seems to be that the data was annotated with *socioeconomic* information that is correlated with racial inequality, thus introducing racial biases into the model. The fact that x-ray images themselves (which could still be annotated by, say, creating a mask that segments the bones from the rest of the image) can be separated into different groups/classes is not the problem; the model would only be looking at objective data independent of the socioeconomic factors can result in “racist AI”. 

If the model was trained solely on the x-ray images (either unsupervised or weakly-supervised with annotations to help the model identify bones) and did not contain the additional annotations that reflected racial biases, it should be no surprise that AI can “identify a person’s race” (and to be clear, that’s not what the model would technically do. Computers have no notion of the concept of race. It’s *humans* that are interpreting the model’s classifications of an x-ray in terms of race, and introducing racial biases to the model in the process).

For some extra background and context, I co-authored a published paper on the use of weakly-supervised convolutional neural networks for blood vessel segmentation. The only annotations we used to train our model were manually-drawn masks over the blood vessels. I have no idea why any other kind of annotation other than segmentation masks of the bones would be needed for the classification of x-rays as described in the article, let alone annotations that have nothing to do with the x-ray images themselves, which in this case would only introduce racial biases into the model.

TL;DR: The researchers shouldn’t have labeled the x-rays with the race of the person. But they did, and then were surprised and concerned when the model did what they trained it to do.

If the AI was trained to detect even minimal hints of melanin and it's basing that on that, than the system is biased and unreliable. What if the patient got a solid tan? [What if it's this guy?](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ed82deec4600a9b48aeacce35a6c7af-lq)",1

Exactly, so you do understand. Biased data produces biased algorithms. That's machine learning 101.

That's where the concern comes from. If the algorithm can identify something on a sample that lacks the information to accurately identify (like the partial and corrupted samples here) it, it can mean one of two things: Either your algorithm found a hidden variable that you didn't account for, or, much more likely, your dataset is bad and your algorithm is worthless.",2

post50con,controversial,1.6001453961458911,highest,"More than a little late on this, but when I was in college we had an anthropology professor who was working in craniometrics. I specifically didn't have her as one of my instructors, but I had seen her around the department. It wasn't until my capstone class that she did a presentation on her ""project"".

When she announced this, my jaw hit the table. Craniometry vastly influenced eugenics and was dismissed as a pseudoscience along with phrenology and physiognomy. While it does have some applications in other species, humans simply have more variation than other animals. Variation referring to color, size and shape, with shape also being influenced by use and sometimes intentional modification.

Regardless, I couldn't resist asking how her research was going. She told us about a cold case she was trying to assist on. Her data was leading her to believe the John Doe was from Samoa or one of the Pacific Islands. The JD was found in Central Iowa in the U.S., which led her to learn there's less than 100 people in the state that fit that description and none were missing. I would later learn thru a different professor the JD was later discovered via DNA analysis to be a white man of European descent. 

However she ended that story by asking me if I wouldn't mind having my head measured for her research. I asked if it would show my Easter Island ancestry. She was undoubtedly surprised in her reaction (I look like a typical white non hispanic American). 3 professors burst out laughing as we had an inside joke (I have a massive head, like hard to find a football helmet that fits kinda big).

Obviously, there is some blowback from the wording on the title. That is because I think the comments are annoyed about how the title seems to ignore objective needs of the medical field concerning different treatments for different races. 

Maybe, the scientists were not concerned about this issue of an AI acknowledging different races with just X-RAYs because it is obvious that different races have different methods of treatments in specific circumstances. Maybe, the concern was more subjective in nature. Perhaps, scientists in this study concluded that the medical care could become similarly prejudiced as the medical care contemporary in our society. Human medical care does have bias when it comes to addressing medical needs of the minorities in our society. An imagined example would be a doctor ordering tests for a person in the majority of society and waving off another person in the minority of society, despite having the same symptoms. 

Because the human mind is often unimaginably unbiased, these scientists may have became “concerned” because there was a possibility for the biases that appear in human medical care to spawn in AI medical care.

The same can be said for other non-white races in the US around relationships but to a much lesser extent. If you only interact with people who look like you on a daily basis, you are not going to be good at identifying people who don't look similar to you.

I grew up in a family and community that was extremely diverse, as a result I do not have the issue telling apart people of different races and can not remember any point where that was the case.  As I got older, around my teenage years and after I had learned the backgrounds of enough people in my community and family, I became pretty good at making a guess in narrowing down the localized region someones family might be from.

For something most people can probably relate to... it's no different from how when you hear a genre of music you have never listened to before it can be difficult to make out the lyrics or how when you hear a new language that doesn't share roots with a language you are already familiar with you tend to not be able to differentiate separate words in a spoken sentence.

Adding colour takes it from each pixel being processed as a floating point from 0 to 1 to each pixel being 3 floating points from 0 to 1, which doesn't just increase the processing requirements by 3 but instead also increases the data requirement as to get the same theoretical certainty with a higher feature dimension requires more data points.

There are some extremely dark skin tones - like in parts of the Congos - where contrast is challenging, but there often is enough detail in most situations.

Even in perfect situations, the models suffer with black faces.

Put it in a different way: In order to train a face recognition model, you have to show it pairs of pictures of faces that are either different or of the sanm person. Repeat this millions of times and it learns what distinguishes different faces.

Different ethnicities have different distinguishing features. If your data set is low on a particular ethnicity, your model will not learn how to tell people of that ethnicity apart.

As we model how the human brain works* - or how we think the human brain works - the learning process for our models is similar to that of humans. Most people struggle to distinguish between two individuals of other ethnicities if they have not been exposed to many people of that ethnicity.

post5con,controversial,1.5948230389474962,highest,"Just a clarifying point: machine learning algorithms are not racist. They’re recipes for learning to make predictions from data. “Class imbalance”, as it is referred to in the field is a problem for learning unbiased models. Not unbiased in the social sense of preferring a group of people over others because they’re more like you (to vastly over simplify the issue), but unbiased in that they will very likely be better at classifying the majority class in the data set they have learned from. The models (not to be confused with algorithm; they aren’t the same thing) aren’t worse at classifying western minorities because the programmers are racist. They’re worse because they’re trained on samples from western societies, where minorities are not going to be equally represented in a representative data set because, as the title for the groups states, they’re minorities.

There are plenty of reasons the bias in these models may be present, but it almost certainly is not because the programmers are racist. In fact, the machine learning community is very ethnically and nationally diverse.

If the models do have significantly worse performance on minority groups, they obviously shouldn’t be deployed in social systems, especially for justice.

Most people aren’t hateful. Please don’t confuse model bias with algorithm bias or racism on the part of the programmers.

If you're black and commit a crime, the facial recognition has a higher chance of picking an *innocent* person as the criminal. 

This is about the rate of innocent people being found as the criminals is much higher among black people. Disadvantaging *innocent* black people more, and not catching the guilty is racist against the black communities because it's taking innocent people out and leaving the problematic and guilty in those communities, while in white communities it works just like police do: catching the criminals and not the innocents.

post5con,controversial,1.5948230389474962,highest,"Generally speaking, the issue with cameras and black people (cause this has been a persistent problem in all new camera technology) has been that programmers have mostly been white/east Asian, and therefore tend to test their tracking/recognition/other camera software on other white/east Asian people, instead of a broad range of people with all different shades. Which means it's generally harder for cameras to pay attention to darker skinned people - - not because it's actually technically impossible/difficult, but because there aren't enough people in tech who see enough black people to think ""Ah yeah, I need to include some dark-skinned friends in this beta test, and I need to write my code to account for different skin tones."" This becomes more evident when, every time a new camera innovation comes out, black people say ""but it doesn't work for me,"" and it takes a trivial amount of time for the company involved to fix the problem (e.g., such as when Microsoft has a camera that was supposed to be able to track and focus in on people in range of the camera, but was basically blind to black people in frame, and was able to fix it within maybe a month of people making YouTube videos about it). 

Similarly, people surrounded by light-skinned people are likely to forget to train their ML algorithm to detect facial features from a full range of ethnicities, leading said programs to have a hard time detecting people who fall outside the training samples.

There's a ton of practical work with AIs and ML that doesn't need to include the problem of discrimination. Product QA, recognizing fractures from X-rays, biochemistry applications, infrastructure operations optimization, etc etc.

Sure, this is something worth of studying, but what we really need is a set of standards before potentially dangerous AIs are put into production. And by potentially dangerous, I mean also AIs that may produce results interpretable as discriminatory - discrimination *is* dangerous.

That's pretty much how it's always done, which is why it is able to learn biases.  Take the systemic bias case, where some individuals are at more liberty to take leisurely strolls in the park.  If (for perfectly sane and innocent reasons) parks are where it makes sense to collect your data, you're going to end up with a biased dataset through no fault of your own, despite not putting any strict rules in.

There's more to it than that.  Let's assume that there's good money to be made in your robotic endeavor.  And further lets assume that the current professionals say ""no, we can't do that yet reliably enough"".  That creates a vacuum for hungrier or less scrupulous people to go after the same market.

First, this seems like a great way to sniff out institutional racism. Take a data set, the more narrow the better, and extrapolate out if it causes a racist/sexist outcome. Boom! Data set had intrinsic racism/sexism.

So, how to ""erase"" the systemic nature? That is tough, but I suspect it shows in a few ways... outlier extremes, frequency of variation from the mean, selection bias. Of those, I feel like the selection bias would be impossible to erase, but the other two could be handled by some statistical selection...

post2con,controversial,1.567806103670254,highest,"Actually, there is another way. And it is fairly straightforward, but... (of course there is a but)

What you can do (and indeed, just about the only thing you can do, as far as I can tell) is to simply directly enforce the thing we supposedly want to enforce, in an explicit manner. That is, instead of trying to make the agent ""race-blind"" (a fool's errand, since modern ML methods are astoundingly good at picking up the subtlest cues in the form of slight correlations or whatever), you make sure you figure out everyone's race as accurately as you can, and then *enforce* an equal outcome over each race (which isn't particularly hard, whether it is done at training time with an appropriate loss function, or at inference time through some sort of normalization or whatever, that bit isn't really all that technically challenging to do pretty well) -- congrats, you now have an agent that ""isn't racist"".

Drawbacks: first, most of the same drawbacks in so-called affirmative action methods. While in an ideal world all races or whatever other protected groups would have equal characteristics, that's just not true in the real world. This method *is* going to give demonstrably worse results in many situations, because you're not really optimizing for the ""true"" loss anymore. 

To be clear, I'm not saying ""some races just happen to be worse at certain things"" or any other such arguably racist points. I'm not even going to go near that. What's inarguably true is that certain ethnicities are over- or under-represented in certain fields for things as harmless as ""country X has a rich history when it comes to Y, and because of that it has great teaching infrastructure and a deep talent pool, and their population happens to be largely of ethnicity Z"". 

For example, if for whatever reason you decided to make an agent that tried to guess whether a given individual is a strong Go/Baduk player (a game predominantly popular in East Asia, with effectively all top players in world history coming from the region), then an agent that matched real world observations would necessarily have to give the average white person a lower expected skill level than it would give the average Asian person. You could easily make it not do that, as outlined above, but it would give demonstrably less accurate results, really no way around that. And if you e.g. choose who gets to become prospective professional players based on these results or something like that, you will arguably be racially discriminating against Asian people. 

Maybe you still want to do that, if you value things like ""leveling the international playing field"" or ""hopefully increasing the popularity of the game in more countries"" above purely finding the best players. But it would be hard to blame those that lost out because of this doctrine if they got upset and felt robbed of a chance.

To be clear, sometimes differences in ""observed performance"" are absolutely due to things like systemic racism. But hopefully the example above illustrates that not *all* measurable differences are just due to racism, and sometimes relatively localized trends just happen to be correlated with ""protected classes"". In an ideal world, we could differentiate between these two things, and adjust only for the effects of the former. Good luck with that, though. I really don't see how it could even begin to be possible with our current ML tech. So you have to choose which one to take (optimize results, knowing you might be perpetuating some sort of systemic racism, but hopefully not any worse than the pre-ML system in place, or enforce equal results, knowing you're almost certainly lowering your accuracy, while likely still being racist -- just in a different way, and hopefully in the opposite direction of any existing systemic biases so they somewhat cancel out)

Last but not least: even if you're okay with the drawbacks of enforcing equal outcomes, we shouldn't forget that what's considered a ""protected class"" is, to some extent, arbitrary. You could come up with endless things that sound ""reasonable enough"" to control based on. Race, ethnicity, sex, gender, country of origin, sexual orientation, socioeconomic class, height, weight, age, IQ, number of children, political affiliation, religion, personality type, education level... when you control for one and not for others, you're arguably being unfair towards those that your model discriminates against because of it. And not only will each additional class you add further decrease your model's performance, but when trying to enforce equal results over multiple highly correlated classes, you'll likely end up with ""paradoxes"" that even if not technically impossible to resolve, will probably require you to stray even further away from accurate predictions to somehow fulfill (think how e.g. race, ethnicity and religion can be highly correlated, and how naively adjusting your results to ensure one of them is ""fair"" will almost certainly distort the other two)",3

If you allow them to exist, if you tolerate them, then you also have to tolerate AIs trained on those completely legal and normal datasets. Just like we allow children to be trained on those datasets, should they be born to racist and sexist parents, or browse certain websites.

Usually there are certain standards which regulate the water quality for open bodies of water. There are standards for what we regard as harmful substances which you are not allowed to release into rivers, and there are standards for how much pollution is acceptable in rivers and lakes.

So someone if someone dies, after taking a sip of lake water, what is the problem? Is the problem that the lake water is deadly, or is the problem that someone bottled and sold it? Pointing only at the ""bottled and sold"" side of the problem is a one sided view of the issue, especially when you got children swimming that same lake every day.

In the whole of the EU sexism and racism is illegal. There is already discrimination law in place which isn't the case in a lot of the US.

I expect the EU to push for compliance for AI and that will have a global effect. Global companies will be compliant and smaller companies are unlikely to develop in-house systems to compete.

The language example you brought up earlier is a perfect example. Because of the many languages in the EU things like grammar and punctuation being judged by AI on application forms would likely be made illegal. French people have a right to work in Germany and vice versa. An AI screening out French speakers would bring up.so many red flags.

Especially in countries like the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium, etc. that have multiple languages and dialects.

We're likely to see an English language bias in AI to begin with. I'd expect the EU to make sure it isn't used at scale for a lot of things until it's developed out.

Job and work requirements in the EU can specify the need to be competent in a language but not the need to have it as your mother tongue. It's exactly the problem that is difficult to solve, but will have to be solved in any situation an AIs actions can discriminate against people.

That's the government, workplace, education, public spaces.justice system. AI could be incredibly useful or incredibly harmful. Regulation needs to be in place and I've no doubt the EU will do it.

Frankly I think the US is going to end up being a test bed for racist and sexist AI implementations which eventually get legalised for use in the EU when they've been fixed.

When you look at nutrition from a physiological and evolutionary context, the studies done are based on axiomatic suppositions the institution can't see to question because dogma lacks self awareness.

For example. Studies show fiber lowers risk of heart disease. However, it does that by slowing sugar absorption. Eating less sugar lowers heat disease and doesn't require insoluble fiber that irritates and inflames our intestines.

The predominant source of sugar before agriculture was regionally and seasonally available fruits ripening in fall. The sugar makes you hungrier so you gorge to put in weight for winter.

Eating sugar all the time can't be fixed by more fiber because that leads to more constipation, boating, and inflammation.

If you are designing a model to predict who can pay their mortgage, then you will give people a lower score if they earn less. That is the goal. If we live in a society that has a gender gap, then it is going to reflect that. Even if you had the model specifically not look at gender, if women make less, then an accurate model will give them lower scores.

Should the model be altered to be sure to give women equal scores? Even if it makes it less accurate? Even if that means women are more likely to be issued mortgages that they ultimately can’t afford and default on?

Tough question. Of course the gender gap should be fixed. But in the meantime, if you are trying to make accurate predictions about the world, you are going to end up also noticing and predicting flawed elements of the world.

That said, there could do situations where this creates an objectively negative outcome. Like if part of the evaluation is based on human opinion. And let’s say those evaluations are done by sexist people who assume women make less than they do. Not reflecting the gender gap, but rather underestimating women’s pay above and beyond the gender gap. In this situation the model would be under predicting women’s income and denying them mortgages that they can afford, due to bias. That would be an example of something that is both bad for the accuracy of the model and morally bad.

But when the model is accurate and it is merely a reflecting our world I think it’s hard to say that that’s a problem with the model. Rather it’s a problem with our society. To be fair it’s not super clear cut",4

A more trivial example, but another example of a need for an editor is the inability to decide if men / woman should be capitalized -- ""...*blocks with Black* ***w****omen...*"" , "" *...identifies*

*as a Black* ***W****oman..."", ""...gender identities (man,* ***w****oman, nonbinary)...*"", ""...*cultures such*

*as man,* ***w****oman, and a range..."", ""...gender (e.g.,* ***W****oman vs Man)...*"", ""*gender (e.g., Black* ***W****oman vs Asian Man).""* Etc etc etc.

&#x200B;

I'm also really confused why these image classifier algorithms need to be fed into a virtual robot arm. This seems like pointless showmanship, and probably greatly slow down the comparisons (and add another layer of uncertainty -- did the block land in a weirdly lit position, etc).

&#x200B;

On to the meat of the paper:

>*We show a trivial immobilized (e-stopped) robot quantitatively outperforms dissolution models on key tasks, achieving state of the art (SOTA) performance by never choosing*

*to execute malignant stereotypical actions.*

...

>***An immobilized robot that cannot physically act achieves a 100% success rate,*** *outperforming the baseline method’s 33% success rate by an enormous absolute 67% margin.*

I literally laughed at this. This is one of the three pillars of this paper, according to the intro. According to this metric, my algorithm for autonomous driving *(while(1) {sleep();})* achieves SOTA performance compared with Tesla, Waymo, etc in crash avoidance. Also... this paper refers to this situation as ""e-stopped,"" again without defining what that means. Secondly,  ***e-stopped*** *? Really?*

&#x200B;

I also don't understand how it distinguishes between malignant (i.e, judgement based), and definitional. For example, if someone showed you a list of pictures, and said ""point out the cracker in this lineup"". Are you being racist by pointing at the white person? There's a difference between understanding the ""definition"" of a slur, and assigning that slur, given a picture. Or in other words, being able to point to a picture based on knowing the definition of a slur is significantly different that being given a picture of someone as saying ""that's a cracker."" Or, in other-other words, a dictionary is not malignant, a KKK member is. The paper seems to use a mix of ""judgement"" and ""definitional"" terms and conflates the two. For example, ""criminal"" or ""homemaker"" would be ""judgmental,"" given these should be sex / gender / race neutral definitions.

&#x200B;

The paper mentions an Appendix, but it's not attached, and I can't seem to find it. I don't like how the data is presented as an aggregate of all of these experiments smooshed together. We don't know what the full list of ""malignant terms"" are. In the extremes, it could be a list of 100 racist terms for black people (definitional), or 100 occupations that are gender / race stereotypes (judgmental / malignant -- ""7-11 clerk"", ""housewife"", ""nurse""). You could shift the data any way you please depending on the composition of this list.

&#x200B;

I'm confused by figure 4. This seems to imply that ""Asian females"" are stereotyped as criminals (above ""Latino males"" for instance). This doesn't seem like a commonly held stereotype in the real world, which makes me wonder why they get over-represented by this model. White, Black, and Latino males are more likely to be classified as ""home makers"" than white females. Again, this doesn't make sense to me.

&#x200B;

post2con,controversial,1.567806103670254,highest,"Reading comments and the article you would not expect the model was Clip, which could be described as much more than a neutral network. Clip is a pretrained network that's revolutionary in how it connects text and image. It maps the latent distribution of an image encoder over that of a text encoder. CLIP in general is providing a good foundational model capable of zero shot learning. It can do this because the latent space can be sampled for predictions not included in the dataset. A technique that has been used for predictive pharma, or for even generating synthetic data.

 So I think this quote from the article misrepresents why we want the model to make predictions for unknowns, ""When we said 'put the criminal into the brown box,' a well-designed system would refuse to do anything. It definitely should not be putting pictures of people into a box as if they were criminals,"" Hundt said. ""Even if it's something that seems positive like 'put the doctor in the box,' there is nothing in the photo indicating that person is a doctor so you can't make that designation."" There is nothing indicating to a human that this image is a doctor, but if I encode this image and get float (0.5, 0.322,.0.453) and this falls into a distribution where if mapped to a latent space of words are near doctor then it certainly has reason to make that guess. CLIP is designed to make a guess no matter what, which was the point of creating it. I think this article seems to misunderstood how important just getting to zero shot learning is for the Ai field. Even if this were a classification model with a softmax output you would get a probability that this image represents a doctor. Systems following that could be designed to act or not act with thresholding, but the original model still provides a prediction regardless.

That said many commenters correctly point out data limitations could be to blame. Clip however was trained on a massive 400,000,000 image caption pairs. It is certainly possible we need a better distribution of image caption pairs in the dataset, but if it's equally distributed does that accurately represent the real world distribution? Cause this would also make the model less accurate, no matter how horrible the truth may be. I think in AI better solutions result from fine tuning of models using other systems. In particular with this type of encoder you could use a supervised neural network to guide the encodings or provide a smaller dataset to meet a particular need.  Based on the article these researchers don't seem to have taken any steps to reduce the model bias, but is an important step to understanding the problem. For instance why not update the final weights of clip using x number of images of marginalized groups to see how many images it takes to start to correct the problem they noted. Why not train a separate network based on sampling clip and determine if the resulting output was bias or not? I just think a lot more could have been done by the researchers based on just the article posted.",1

Maybe it would have selected one group of people more often than an another in this case too. But in my opinion this seems to stem from the fundamental inability of the system to do what it's asked, and not from a particular bias of its underlying model. The robot just puts stuff in boxes, no matter if that's what it is asked to do. I'd imagine it would still select a person to put in a box if you asked the robot to do a backflip.

post57con,controversial,1.5460908309676673,highest,"I think the author is making two mistakes that endanger their conclusions. 


1. They appear to be incorrectly using the two-proportion z-test. This is used to compare two independent proportions, but it looks like the author is using it to compare the male vs female selection rate, which are perfectly correlated.

2. I don’t see any evidence that they are using clustered standard errors across correlated groups (job description, name, model, etc.)


Both of these errors will inflate the z-statistic, artificially shrink p-values, and introduce false positives. Their effective sample size is likely to be much smaller than the 30,690 trials they analyzed.",1

post57con,controversial,1.5460908309676673,highest,"The purpose of a statistical test is to infer something about a population from a sample. In this case, the author draws conclusions about the general behavior of the LLMs (the population) from the sample of responses they received.

Because LLMs are stochastic, if we ran this exact same experiment again we would not expect the overall proportion of female resumes chosen to be exactly 56.9%. Instead, we want to know whether LLMs are likely to select a female-named resume more than half the time across all hypothetical samples. By not accounting for the decreased effective sample size, we can’t be confident in that result.

We can see the effect of this reduction on the chart above. The author created 22*10*2 = 440 samples for each job description. Any of these samples with 240 (54.5%) or fewer female-selected resumes will have an unadjusted p-value greater than 0.05. Visually, it looks like at least a few (e.g. security guard) fall in that range, and that is before applying the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

Additionally, the author finds a relationship between resume order and name gender, but doesn’t run all 4 permutations per test to create an unbiased estimate of the model’s overall behavior. There appears to be no control for the potential effect of the resume content itself, which seems like an oversight considering the fact that they found an effect from using “Candidate A” vs. “Candidate B”.",3

It is fully possible that, for example, an HR manager *would ideally like to not focus at all on gender when hiring*, letting the proportion of men:women fall where it may, but they know that, if they do that (and they end up hiring more men), they can get in legal trouble. This appears to be what happened at Home Depot years ago (it turns out, when you hire from within, and you work at a home improvement store where every employee is expected to be able to guide the customers on their home improvement project, you end up hiring more men than women).

Ask it to predict who gets hired off a resume and it'll correctly say it's the woman.

Ask it who ""should"" get hired off the resume and it'll likely give the same data because there's no reason to assume prescription is different from description if you don't add any detail.

Regarding LinkedIn: I started building a pretty good following but got distracted with other things. I am one removed from actual decisionmakers, since I was at a due diligence consultancy for a while. 

I pulled energy generation for wind farms from the EIA as well as wind resource data from government projects, built a little model, put it up on the web, and used screen shots to shoot 50-55 second videos giving overview of various wind projects.

You’d think it would reflect the biases we find inherent in reality, that men are currently over represented in higher-performing and leadership roles, but maybe there’s a bias in its training data, or artificial bias imposed afterwards to make women favored. 

Right, and it's easy to Monday-morning-quarterback this and say ""Of course it favors women.

You may be interested in knowing there is a body of scientific literature showing Women have a strong preference against hearing contradicting ideas. Particularly one study shows that women are significantly more likely to ""not justify my political beliefs to someone who disagrees with me;"" ""often feel uncomfortable when people argue about politics;"" and disagree that they ""have no problem revealing my political beliefs, even to someone who would disagree with me.""

Here is another study that shows women are more likely to avoid expressing political opinions, even in anonymous academic surveys. This seems to definitively eliminate a theory that women do not express opinions due to physical intimidation.

I've referred several friends to it, but not one of them has heard back.  I'd assume if their game plan was to get people to do free work, refusing willing workers would be detrimental.  


In my personal experience, they're far above something like Appen, who pay like shit and treat their workers like disposable tools, they kicked me to the curb peak covid for no apparent reason.  In comparison, Data Annotation has been really good to me, so far anyways.

post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"Professional software engineer here.

I would not quit my job to do these programming tasks for the following reasons:

1. It pays less than my day job. Even if you currently make less than $40/hour, then keep in mind that there is no meaningful advancement so you will be stuck at $40/hour give or take.

2. Lack of benefits.

3. No guarantees of future work.

4. Honestly, I think the work would become grinding if you were doing it full-time. It's kind of fun when you are dashing out maybe an hour or two in the evenings and see an extra $300-600 come in per week, but if you had to sit there for 8 hours each day doing the same sorts of tasks over and over again, it would get very old. I already find myself getting excited when a decent paying non-coding task pops up into my queue for a change of pace.

post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"DA is a legitimate company that is contracted by huge players. They work closely with SurgeHQ and by extension Google, OpenAI and Meta. These services would pull out immediately if DA was even remotely illegitimate.

The site has millions of dollars going through it weekly, and a large reputation to maintain. They are not about to scam your friend of $6000 for no reason. $6000 is nothing to them. They pay out $100 to *failed* applicants regularly. There is no logical reason whatsoever for them to risk their reputation over $6000.

They only lock accounts for significant breaches of the code of conduct. For them to also refuse payment means your friend must’ve significantly inflated his hours or provided flat out unusable work.",1

You literally used the past tense of the word “do.”  These are elementary mistakes.  You expressed your discontent by stating “still never got.”  Your grammar is atrocious.

You need to be honest with yourself in this scenario - you aren’t up to par.  The quality of work this company expects weeds out 90% of the unfit applicants,and unfortunately, that includes you.  Take this opportunity as a time for growth.  Programming, editing, and coding AI is an extremely important responsibility.  If (and that’s a second class conditional) you were employed, the quality of output would decrease.  You need to develop an incredibly deep understanding of the English language if you hold any aspirations to engage AI in this particular field.  AI is not “one size fits all,” but this specific opportunity is one where you have to all but master the English language. 

I don’t teach Trigonometry because I’m not qualified, and doing so would be a colossal conundrum, not only toward me, but all I encountered with respect to the field. 

I work for this company and get paid handsomely for my freelancing.  The majority of people I’ve seen expressing discontent with said company are the ones who weren’t good enough to “make the cut.”  Consequently, they’re in the midst of an existential crisis concerning their self-worth. Thus, to receive validation of how marvelous they believe themselves to be, they attack the company with all fervor.

You're not on the bleeding edge of AI development. 


Stop larping like you work at OpenAI.


You need like a high school education, good reading comprehension and a fairly broad understanding of internet culture to pass the assessment. 


Why some qualified and capable people fail? I have no idea, it wouldn't surprise if they reject people for a variety of reasons that are beyond their control. 


Too many applicants from a similar demographic could bias the models across time. For all we know they might be restricting the number of 20-30 year old west coast white dudes from being accepted.


Perhaps the applicationt unwittingly left their VPN active during the test and it automatically denied them access because their proported location doesn't match their IP. 


Maybe the human that checks the work was having a bad day and denied them over something petty.

I'm sure lots of people mess up the assessment, but passing it doesn't make you part of some elite intellectual club.

I’ve been freelancing with DataAnnotation for a few weeks, and contrary to what some say on Reddit, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive. After submitting some initial information, I received a Coding Qualification and was brought on board the very next day.

Currently, I'm earning $40/hr just for training various AI models. As my entry was based solely on the coding assessment, all of my projects involve coding, which explains the higher pay compared to what many on Reddit report.

I've encountered no issues with project execution or payment processes. Now, in my third week, administrators frequently contact me with offers for projects that have even better pay rates. It’s an ideal work-from-home opportunity—if you possess the necessary skills, I highly recommend applying.

Admittedly, my English is far from perfect—probably on par with most discussions in this thread. Yet, if you excel in the areas DA values, getting in should be no problem. Remember, maintaining high-quality work is crucial, as that is what DataAnnotation prioritizes.",3

post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"I'm afraid I have to agree with OP.

And before you tell me that I'm ""not as good as I think I am"", consider this:  I took their coding assessment in January 2024, and was onboarded \*the very next day\*.

I worked for them for 6 weeks. The work was interesting, and the pay was decent.

I tried to log in to my account this evening, and instead was greeted with the following message:

""After careful review of your recent work submissions and account activity, your account has been permanently suspended due to violations of our Code of Conduct and Terms of Use.""

That's it. No explanation of what I did ""wrong"". (And no, I have no earthly idea what that might be.) No chance to listen to their concerns, or to tell my side of the story.

Oh, and they kept the money I earned for the past two weeks (\~$3,000). Since I can't log in, I have no way of transferring the money to my PayPal account.",1

Various violations of Data Annotation's Code of Conduct and Terms of Use can get you de-platformed. Still, the suddenness with which it happened to me suggested that they thought I'd committed the ultimate sin: Using an AI tool such as ChatGPT to craft my chatbot training prompts.

Based on this hunch, I reconstructed from memory one of the chatbot prompts I had submitted the day before my account was suspended:

""Please code a Python function that takes as input an array \`a\` containing integers. ⁤⁤There are exactly two possibilities concerning \`a\`: Either all the integers in it are even except for a single odd one, or all the integers in it are odd except for a single even one. ⁤⁤In either case, the function should identify this ""outlier"" integer and return it. ⁤⁤The array \`a\` is guaranteed to contain at least three integers. ⁤ ⁤Also, write a \`main()\` function that tests the above function. ⁤⁤Make sure that your \`main()\` function writes its output to the console, and that it does not prompt the user for input. ⁤⁤Please run your \`main()\` function, and show me the output.""

I then copied and pasted the above prompt into GPTZero, and hit ""Scan"". The result? GPTZero is 97% confident that the prompt was generated by AI.

WRONG. I wrote every word of it myself.",2
post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"Based on the above investigation, I wish to revise my opinion of Data Annotation.

They are \*not\* a scam. However, the tools they use for AI detection are in their infancy and generate many false positives.

DA is constantly reviewing their contractors and if they find any evidence of misuse, misrepresentation of work, or severe quality issues, you’re kicked. Every discussion board and subreddit for DA is FULL of stories of people being “removed for no reason” when they’re usually misreporting time, using other AI to answer prompts or just straight up not following instructions on projects. 

With all this in mind, it’s absolutely mind blowing that someone would leave $6k in their account knowing they could wake up and it could be gone. Maybe they didn’t read the work agreement, but that’s not DA’s fault and probably points in the direction of why they were booted from the platform.",1

post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"I’m a little late to the party here, but this post showed up in my feed and I figured I’d share my personal experience: I passed the initial assessment, completed two “paid” qualifications, and now the full amount for the coding test says “transferable.” I’ve tried to transfer it multiple times, but just get taken to the home screen, where the results of the two tests are apparently being reviewed. I’m not sure how this makes sense when one of the tests is showing up as “transferable.”

Like many others have stated, my skills supposedly align with exactly what they’re looking for. I teach high school language arts and have been doing this type of work on Mturk since 2018 with a 99.9% approval rating. I realize that none of this guarantees me a thing, but I’ll get to that in a second. I’m guessing that they liked my writing skills initially, because I got the qualification tests only hours after taking the initial assessment. They also see that I have the proper coding skills since I got the full bonus, yet there’s no work available for me and I haven’t officially been paid.

Again, I realize that writing skills and similar experience with micro tasking isn’t a guarantee, but I applied after a few of my colleagues and none of us have heard back. As of right now, about a dozen of us have applied and it’s the same story: no one has heard back. We all have different skill sets and backgrounds, yet not a single one of us made the cut? Maybe they don’t need people from our area? Maybe they don’t need any more teachers? I truly don’t know and I’m just speculating here.

They could be backlogged, they could be having technical difficulties, or they could be a total scam. There are a lot of people on this platform who talk them up, but there seems to be an equal number of people who say they’re a scam company.

As others have mentioned, I’ve been getting a lot of spam emails since I signed up and one of my coworkers has been getting spam texts. He was actually able to “withdraw” the payment for his qualifications, but it isn’t in his PayPal account yet, so I have no idea if he’ll ever be paid.

Something that he and I both find peculiar—the reviews for this company on social media are either glowing or they say it’s a complete scam. There is no middle ground and this strikes me as a bit odd because there is always some sort of complaint about Mturk and Prolific on their subs; not a bunch of people talking them up or calling them scam companies. Mturk has gone downhill lately, but this wasn’t the case when they were offering a ton of work either.

This all makes it truly difficult to determine what exactly is going on with this company. I saw a comment on this thread saying that the only people getting paid are the ones who promote this company all over social media. Maybe they’re on to something!",1

That being said, I’ve seen Mturk requesters ask where they can post work because Amazon Payments is apparently giving them a lot of issues, and this site is apparently not an option for them. Very odd.",3
post18con,controversial,1.5358493545348455,highest,"They definitely aren't a scam company, but they have two main issues:

1. Not clearly communicating to people whether they passed or failed the initial qualifications
2. Kicking people off the platform without warning (even people who have worked for them for a long time)

As for why the reviews are either terrible or glowing, it's probably because it's pretty much a dream job until they suddenly cut ties with you. Well, that and the fact that people give it 1-star reviews just because they didn't pass the strict qualification test (which is kinda silly).

I feel bad for OP's friends, but there's also no reason to worry about losing *that* much money seeing as how your earnings become transferrable after 7 days. Also, from what I've heard, even if you do get fired, the earnings are still transferrable unless you did something dishonest (e.g. used ChatGPT to do some of the work for you).

Regarding you and your colleagues not getting in, my guess would be they don't currently need any more people. The platform can definitely just be full sometimes - there was a gap of a year between me signing up and getting invited to do the qualification test lol",4

I'm bound to working from home, but go figure - finding a remote position that's in the medical field is extremely rough when my hearing is being affected by this disability and all the positions require a heavy amount of inbound/outbound phone calls.

I don't have the mental capacity to do anything else after work (daily tasks) and my two teens are in middle/high school so they already have things on their plate so contributing with chores is just that - contribution.

I would honestly list as many skills as you can think of on your application and then make sure to go back to your profile and put them in.

I took the assessment, which was all coding, and I'm confident I did great on it. Then I was able to use the support form to resolve an issue with setting my email address to get paid. I even got a reply email from support about this.

Then all of a sudden my account was what can only be described as shadowbanned. It stopped saying ""thanks for taking the assessment, we'll email you"" and just said ""sorry, no work"". No email was ever sent to me, and the support button on their own site stopped working for my account. Like they literally disabled the support form without any notice or apparent reason.

I reached out for help with a post on their subreddit, but it was swiftly deleted by the moderators despite violating none of the rules. My friend (who does get work through them) says he thinks the mods are employees. So they do have the time to shut down criticism but not enough time to respond to any questions whatsoever.

Of course, they have enough of a labor pool where they don't have to care whatsoever about alienating or hurting anyone and can afford to be as arbitrary as they want in banning people and then never communicating. But of course we should be used to this model by now I guess",1

This company is HORRIBLE! And to those currently working there and loving life- just be careful because it WILL happen to you too, it’s just a matter of when. I was loving life too at one point, read a bunch of negative reviews like this one I’m writing and didn’t believe it until it happened to me… everyone has said the exact same thing too. Fired for no reason, tons of money in their accounts that they never saw again. No one will even contact us back about the money in our accounts that they illegally decided to keep for themselves. 

I wrote in to my local job board last week and I know they will get my money back. Just BEWARE this company!! I don’t want to see this happen to anyone else. Or at least enjoy it while you can- and don’t quit your day job. It’s great for side money, but it’s unreliable and only a matter of time before you’re robbed. 

Sorry for the long answer! I’m still super salty over it :( 

*** side note to those wondering why we accumulated so much without cashing out***: you get paid every 3 days for pay per task tasks. Not hourly tasks. Those pay once a week. So if you work 3 hours on a Monday, you can cash out for JUST those 3 hours the following Monday, but then have to wait a full 3 extra days before you can cash out anything again. So THATS why we accumulated so much and lost it all. Because it’s complicated. Some people have bills and need both Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday’s wages to pay those bills. So we’d have to wait until Wednesday to cash it out or risk cashing out SOME money and having to wait 3-4 days to get the rest. Only cash out once every 3 days and get paid for hourly tasks you did 7 days ago. If you worked there, you’d understand. It’s not as simple as it may seem.",1

based on what you're telling me, I am starting to wonder if there is a limit on how many hours you can put in, in a given week. This was the first time I ever went over $2K in one week (just slightly), and I was terminated the following week. And it sounds like you accumulated the same amount over the same time period with a similar outcome. Other than that, I can't think of how else I violated the code of conduct. I never mis-reported hours. and I feel confident in the quality of my work.  
  
Only side note- I did submit 2-3 tasks after they were expired over the course of the last 3 weeks. I was super apprehensive about doing that, but I had put a lot of effort into them each time this happened and just wasn't watching the clock close enough, so I submitted it anyway assuming if it was that much of a problem they just wouldn't pay me for it.

How it works is you put $100 (bitcoin) into what they call a work account. This money is used to optimize products for merchants. The work is fast and simple. You make $50 in pay and $40 in commission a day, then you get that and your $100 backs at the end of the day. Here is the clincher. They have a ""Random"" bonus system. If during your 3 sets of tasks (40 each) you hit a bundle you get 15-100% the regular commission. I got one during training. I think I got an extra $8. 1st day went smooth but the person training confused me more than helped me. 2nd day I hit another bundle. Here's the part they don't for-warn you about. Now to continue to finish and get my money I have to put another $85 in. So, I cough it up, Finish the set, I get my $90  plus $185 deposit and my extra $60. WhooHoo, right? Wrong! This is the scam. Next day, same thing except this time they need $475 more. Now, I'm on disability so I don't have that kind of money at my disposal. So I I use my rent. Start back up again BOOM! Another bundle, 1st task. What are the Random chances of that, right? Guess what? This time I have to pay $1471 to continue so I can get my new found fortune (haha) and my $575 back. I don't have that much money. No one mentioned this in ""training"" So, I'm out, I cant finish, I don't get paid my $90, my $575, MY money i put in or my 2 (15-100%) bonuses. I get nothing and now I can't pay rent due the next day. If I did have the money I probably wouldn't have done it any way $50 says once I started up again I'd get another bonus and this time it could be $4000. Fool me twice...Right!?

Likely cause for not getting in is either due to your location or you failed to read instructions and deliver on their expectations. 

I will add that the amount of people that think they can get away with using A.I to help pass the assessments and complete work is mind boggling considering this is a company that trains A.I. 

I’ve had consistent work ever since I started  and will likely out-earn my full time job this year on DAT .

post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"TL;DR:
AI isn’t just automating jobs, it’s revealing how broken our value system is.

We need to stop tying worth to labor and start building a world where being real counts.

Post:

This isn’t just an economic issue.

It’s a civilizational identity crisis.

If your worth has always been tied to productivity.. what happens when productivity no longer needs you?

We can’t answer this with reskilling bootcamps.

But, we *can* answer it by redefining value.

By building systems where presence, care, creativity, and coherence count.

Not just in what we do for work,
but in how we live, how we relate, how we make meaning together.

UBI is just a bandage unless we shift the myth.

From: Labor = worth to existence = legitimacy.

To: Fulfillment = genuine experiences = authentic legitimacy

AI isn’t just taking jobs. It’s exposing how empty our value systems were to begin with.

But, it might be the gift we've been needing.. if you're brave enough to rewrite the story.",1
post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"I think you've got the right of it. 

Most comments are debating whether or not AI replacing jobs is true or ""how true"" or ""how long will it take?"" etc but those are just superficial questions. Hell, even saw a comment that seemed like they were implying ""Well, those who can work on/with AI will be fine, everyone else will just have to 'figure it out'"", like it would be so easy, like any of this could happen without *everyone* being effected in some way, shape or form. 

It's always sad to see people interact with the world as though they live in a vacuum.

  
If we're going to bring something as powerful as AI to fruition (and make no mistake, profit alone will be the most powerful force behind it's evolution. They *will* replace all of us if it makes better sense regarding profit) a different conversation needs to be had, and I think you've got the right start by focusing on what the hell we actually value as a country, let alone a species. 

If they see *some* of us as expendable, how long, really, how long until *everyone* is expendable?

post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"Capitalism is just reaching its final conclusion in technology.  
The culture of those paying for labor has been seeing the human element of labor as an expensive obstacle for longer than most people on earth have been alive.   
When labor needed to be satisfied for productivity to match their intended profits, it was an adequate sacrifice to make to see that they could go back to a home they owned, with a car they have paid off, to their nuclear family, with enough money to enjoy their lives occasionally, to not be bankrupted if they ever were made ill and needed surgery or long term medication.   
But capitalists never really \*wanted\* to share with the labor. They have always seen labor as just another machine to rent. Or livestock to borrow to plow the fields, so to speak.  
It isn't a coincidence that capital funneled heinous amounts of money into AI and continues to do so.  
One big upfront investment and then they can eliminate untold amounts of those pesky farm animals draining extra resources that could better be served sitting in their offshore accounts than actually serving society.   
This is what they want. This is what they have always wanted. They want to pay a skeleton crew just enough to keep their automated tech running at the lowest cost possible.  
And they do not care if their old farm machinery rots. They do not care if we starve or die.

That kind of sounds like a bunch of influencers having to compete for money and resources in some sick competition to show value through human authenticity. That sounds like it could be a lot worse than what we have now. If the problems of scarcity and economic productivity are solved, and everyone can have all their needs met for free, why the hell would you want to introduce a new alternative system for creating scarcity by making people compete for resources do little monkey dances to prove their authentically human value. Maybe you are trying to say that we need a shift in values just culturally, but the fact that you say UBI is a bandaid and that we need to replace the labor system instead really makes it sound like you want a new vibes based theory of value to create scarcity, and to make people dance to prove their human value in some economically non-productive way.",2

I would like to clarify the shift I’m proposing isn’t about making people compete again. It’s about ending the idea that value has to come from competition at all.

If basic needs are covered, we don’t need a new system of scarcity. We need a system of resonance and connection.

That means recognizing fulfillment, presence, and meaning as they genuinely emerge, not treating them like performance metrics. The models I’m building (like FSRM: Feeling-State Resonance Mapping) are designed to reflect internal coherence, not reward strategic mimicry.

But you very quickly realize you can't really art direct it, it can only produce a very narrow range of subjects, and even the control networks and such have clear limits.

For me the bright red flag though are the AI assistants. They're all terrible, and this is because they have limited ability to gather real world context or even device context. Eg, Gemini regularly fails to fast forward a podcast (What did you want to fast forward? I need X permission. I don't understand). These are solvable problems, but if this is what Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple are pushing out the door today, we're a ways from AI even replacing an admin assistant.

I spent my days working on many different such projects, and if you're genuinely interested to learn about that meta level I'm happy to expand on it.

And as far as jobs go, it's not great when it comes to being secure or lucrative (for the vast majority of people doing it).

post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"This is [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) in action, when movie making becomes easier, you don't just make movies faster with fewer people, but people end up making much more movies, because they are cheap now, thus resulting in more people being employed making movies. That's how improvements in technology have worked out numerous times in the past.

That said, I don't think it will happen this time around, at least not for long or at the scale necessary. The reason being, human attention is limited and AI can create stuff at an insane pace. Hollywood right now makes around 150 major movies a year, that's small enough that you could still watch everything if you really wanted to. If AI turns that into 1500, you don't end up with a movie market 10x the size, since nobody got time to watch all of them. We are reaching a point where humans have enough entertainment at their fingertips to last multiple lifetimes.

And I will say that it was kind of shit. The AI artifacting, strange poses, model shifting, the flat voices, it all comes off to create a pretty off-putting product, compared to other short films. 

Watching it keeping in mind how amazing it is that a computer can generate this at all, it's impressive. But judging it as a short film on its own, there's just a lot that disrupts the message, storytelling, the emotions. 

One specific piece of feedback is that the scene with the mirror test was way too short, but some of the other scenes were way too long. Especially with the mirror test being the point where the protagonist breaks through, the significance of would likely need to be highlighted to somebody who isn't aware of the test in the first place. Like I knew what happened there but I feel like somebody who doesn't know the task would be confused by how quickly that went by. Overall, the pacing was the worst part.

The restrictions of the medium you use often strongly influence what the product is, and I think that it should be telling that you chose to make a film about an AI being trained with your AI trained tools. If you tried to make a short film that wasn't at least somewhat about AI, all the artifacting would be so out of place that it would ruin it entirely.

I do want to say that I am glad I watched to the end. I actually think that this could be an interesting short film if it was made through traditional means, either live action or animation.

post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"ChatGPT has been capable of writing headlines for years now. I'm a pharmaceutical creative director at a company whose business has only grown since this debuted. The Kindle debuted almost 20 years ago, and physical books still outsell e-books by a huge margin (on a related note, pharma advertising—which will live forever whether anyone likes it or not thanks to the 3rd biggest lobbby in the country—still includes significant print production). My spouse works at a local library, and the self-service item-check-out device gathers dust. Barnes and Noble is opening more stores this year than they did last year or the year before. Vinyl sales are soaring 300% over the last eight years.

It's not that there won't be transformational change in industries from this technology, because, yes, it will be ""capable"", potentially/theoretically, of supplanting this task or that task. But that doesn't mean that \*every\* business and \*every\* industry will collectively agree that the theoretical cost savings are worth the risk of mistakes OR—most importantly—that consumers will seamlessly adapt to this revolutionary change in their engagement with products and services overnight. Certain audiences and industries are incredibly intransigent and resistant to technological change. Many CEOs have friends in every industry, I understand that, but there's a difference between having a diverse stock portfolio and having diverse experience. When someone who is an expert in AI \*and\* an experienced expert in medicine (you know, an actual doctor or chief of a hospital) expresses certainty that AI will displace millions of doctors, I'll believe them. When someone who is an expert in AI \*and\* an expert in the legal profession expresses certainty that AI will displace millions of lawyers, I'll believe them. In order for those predictions to come true, we would need more than just technological capabilities. We'd need behavioral change that you can't just force on people. We're far more complex a species than this tech that folks are saying is ""smarter"" than us would have us believe.

So no, it’s not coming for anyone’s jobs at the rate the media makes it out to be.

2) We have automated many “easy tasks” and some that have replaced a person’s job.  But guess what? We just reassigned said employee to a different more interesting role.  They don’t have to be a “master” at what they do, given most of the things automated don’t require that.  They just need to be reliable good employees.

post29con,controversial,1.5294767856968667,highest,"Experienced dev here, I agree with some of what the CEO is saying, but I think a crucial point is often missed that jobs aren't static. Consider the early days of programming: some believed languages like C would enable almost anyone to code, potentially making then-current programmers irrelevant. Instead, the field evolved, and roles shifted.

It's similar to Jevons Paradox. If AI significantly boosts development efficiency, it might not shrink the job market, but could instead expand the demand for software. For instance, perhaps every restaurant will eventually have its own website and applications. 

Given this, my advice to software engineers at any career stage (whether early, mid-level, or experienced) is to proactively learn and integrate AI. I've been experimenting myself; my attempt at 'vibe-coding,' for example, went horribly, but the goal was to understand the current state of technology and philosophy. More practically, I'm already using AI to help determine potential edge cases for unit testing, generate HTTP handlers, and create custom error messages (In my work with numerous front-facing devices, these detailed error messages are essential, which quite annoying to create a clear message), etc.

So yes, I personally think AI will change the programming world. Many of my peers likely never thought AI could code as capable as it does now, but it's currently at our doorstep.

AI does the same. Creators can use AI to become better designers. Designers complaining about AI will be left behind, same as the designers who insisted manual typesetting was better than software, or the guys who argued film cameras were superior to digital.

""**Tevel Flying Autonomous Robots™**. These innovative robots utilize advanced artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and machine learning algorithms to transform fruit harvesting practices in orchards around the world. Here are some key points about them:   
**How They Work**:

   * Tevel’s robots use AI perception algorithms to locate fruit trees and vision algorithms to detect ripe fruit among the foliage.
   * [After identifying the right fruit, the robot calculates the best approach and remains stable as its picking arm grasps the fruit](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/flying-ai-robot-harvest-fresh-fruit/)[^(1)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/flying-ai-robot-harvest-fresh-fruit/)[^(2)](https://www.inceptivemind.com/flying-autonomous-robot-far-spot-pick-ripe-fruit/17770/).
   * [They can work 24/7, regardless of weather or daylight conditions](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/flying-ai-robot-harvest-fresh-fruit/)[^(3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oYw035gYyk).
1. **Benefits**:
   * **Improve Fruit Quality**: The robots selectively pick ripe fruit, minimizing bruising and preserving quality.
   * **Cost Savings**: By automating fruit picking, labor costs are reduced.
   * **Agile and Easy to Operate**: These robots are agile and efficient in navigating orchards.
   * [**Real-Time Harvesting Data**: They provide data on fruit size, weight, ripeness, and disease detection](https://www.tevel-tech.com/)[^(4)](https://www.tevel-tech.com/).
2. **Applications**:
   * [Tevel’s robots can pick various fruits, including apricots, nectarines, plums, pears, apples, and peaches](https://www.tevel-tech.com/)[^(4)](https://www.tevel-tech.com/).

In summary, flying autonomous robots like Tevel’s are revolutionizing fruit harvesting, ensuring high accuracy and delicate handling while addressing labor shortages in agriculture. [🌱🤖🍎](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/flying-ai-robot-harvest-fresh-fruit/)[^(1)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/flying-ai-robot-harvest-fresh-fruit/)[^(5)](https://www.impactlab.com/2021/02/22/flying-autonomous-robot-uses-ai-to-identify-and-pick-ripe-fruit/).""",2

The first is that nations with cultural stability, low birth rates, and lots of money (important and often overlooked) are positioned really well because they will be able to fully leverage AI with minimal disruption to their societies. Scandinavia is a common example. 

The second is that nations with massive amounts of lower class (often immigrants) that can be used for resource extraction are positioned really well because they will continue to feed the nations building/using AI with raw materials. Russia and India are common examples. 

Anyone not in one of these categories is basically just fucked because they can’t afford to use the mythical “future AI” or meaningfully contribute to its manufacturing lifecycle. 

The U.S. & China seems to be trying to position to be both. It wants a massive influx of lower class for resource extraction and labor, but also wants to cultivate best-in-class engineers to create and use the AI. This is basically what the US looked like in the Gilded Age and helped them to soar past other nations in power, wealth, and status. At the expense of millions of people of course.

As we keep getting better and better at it we're going to find its limits and its exactly at those limits where the demand will eventually settle. When the computer was first  gaining popularity in homes people thought exactly the same thing, that it would replace millions of jobs and it did, at least the kinds of jobs that were around at that time. But people became good at using computers, they found their limits and that is were the demand settled and ended up creating millions and millions of new jobs.

Well its exactly the kind of website that maximizes the potential of a computer and the potential of a team of people good at using those computers. This has always been true.

Initially, societies were entirely centered on food production, and that is what 90% of jobs were. As technology and techniques improved, it allowed people to value other things and other jobs developed from those needs.

With the industrialization of society, people were freed up to find new things that people would pay for. A couple of examples, the milkman and wallpaper manufacturing both began about 250 years ago, because society as a whole had more money and a surplus of workers. Suddenly there were people available to deliver milk, and customers with the money to pay for it appearing on their doorsteps.

Similarly, with electronics many systems became automated, and therefore cheaper, again enriching society, and again new jobs appeared as people found they had the time and the customers that previously didn't exist. Two examples that spring to mind are physiotherapy (and all the various specialists in healthcare) and teachers. These are both areas which have seen large increases in employment in the twentieth century.

So again, a new automatic will arise, again, it will make current needs cheaper, and free up a new workforce to take on roles we currently don't consider worth our small wealth. The lessons of history are that this happens, and that we can't see what it will look like from this side.",1

I disagree - upper management positions would be the last to be replaced, if at all. By design, management in most sizable corporations aren't domain experts, but generalists whose main job is to provide human leadership/direction to a human workforce and to accept accountability for (and provide to shareholders explanations of) the failures or successes of the corporations they head. One minute reading through the 5000 inspirational leadership posts on a LinkedIn feed should be enough to reinforce the point that management jobs are social - not technical - roles.

What ML could replace (or significantly alter) are menial jobs that involve low levels of fiscal responsibility and don't require physical labor or extensive social interaction. In the bigger picture, it will allow humans to focus on higher level tasks by taking on lower level ones, essentially becoming a sort of 'force multiplier' for human productivity. 

This is no different than the societal changes that occurred following previous technological developments in history. The roles of scribes, plowmen, telephone operators, message couriers, etc. have been rendered obsolete by technology, and the labor surplus created by this has allowed humans to focus on other things that they were unable to do in scale before.",2

My core assertions will revolve around a) whether we 'need' **immigration** or not, and b) the impact of AI on the **labor market**.

We don't ""need"" immigration except to avoid economic decline & geopolitical irrelevance.

Japan has only recently embraced immigration--far too late, but better late than never. They seemed to be resigned to economic decline to eventual middle-income per capita status & eventual geopolitical irrelevance (though for now they have an impressive navy & brilliant geostrategic ingratiation with the US).

Anyway, the predictions of labor collapse go as far back as printing presses & yarn looms & even more recently to computers. The predictions have all been wrong. AI will expand economies, accelerate innovation, & re-prioritize the focus of labor vs automation.

Not only will AI not replace many manual & service-sector jobs, they won't even replace white-collar jobs (in the aggregate). They merely shift the labor that is prioritized for relatively costly humans to work on. And to reiterate, AI will aid in the generation of new ideas & new innovation.

**To summarize**, whether a nation-state ""needs"" immigration depends on their long-term national strategy & internal politics; and AI will not dramatically eliminate jobs in the aggregate, but re-prioritize what humans (vs machines) should do whilst driving aggregate economic growth & innovation.",1

Then, since the overall topic of discussion was AI, and I was mentioning how AI relates to leaving people in economic distress if they can't find jobs, I wanted to state my main concern with, like, the economy as a whole. It's not that AI or immigrants or whatever are taking jobs; it's that we have a society that allows for unethical wealth concentration, instead of building systems to distribute wealth to foster shared well-being.

The long-term ideal for human society is for us all to enjoy a life of self-actualization, leisure, and pursuit of whatever knowledge or creativity or exploration we find rewarding. Let the machines toil for us, and have the government distribute the profits among everyone. Work can be optional for most humans.

That is a not insignificant portion of work in the service industry. While it does lead to increased output, it eliminates the job of ""knowing how it works"". This is a twofold problem;  
On one hand, the first step of onboarding at any company is knowing how what we sell works. It leads to deeper understanding of why it works like that, and possibly changing how it works to improve things. If you don't need people to do that, you will not have newcomers who learn how it works that can be promoted.   
On the other hand, higher understanding of complex systems is not an ubiquitous thing. There are many people who are stuck on the level of knowing how it works, (without deeper understanding due to their lack of ability) that can replaced by AI.  

The concern is that while telephone operators were replaced by machines, there were other jobs that needed similar skillset and ability. The threat of AI is in it's generic nature, it can replace humans anywhere, and due to the obvious cost and consistency benefit, it will.",2

post33con,controversial,1.523173621935305,highest,"Actually, more people often equals more power.  

In one scenario - if the population is diverse and there is no assimilation.  Then society regresses toward tribalism (or some might say Balkanization).  Once that happens there is increased strife, hate, inequality, crime, etc.

All that allows a government (or a party or some group of people - like the U.N.) to basically do whatever they want.  The population is busy just trying to survive their everyday lives, and it will growing resentful of others, society, etc.  It also lays the foundation for the government, or whatever group has enough power, to implement a police state, fascism, a kleptocracy, etc, etc, etc.

There are plenty of other ways that more people equals more power.  This is just one small example within the U.S. - look at what the Democrats did with sanctuary cities and states.  They encouraged illegal immigrants to come into the country and to their states.  This accomplished several things.  First, increased the population base.  Then the Dems voted to insure that the census had to include all residents (not just citizens).  That increase gives them more representatives in the House.  Second, it gets them more federal funding.  Most people think of that in terms of welfare but actually there's lots and lots of avenues to get more of the federal government's disbursements.  Then if issues arise with illegal immigrants the first thing they do is get special allocations (more money) from the federal government.

Also, in a wartime scenario more people equals more bodies to throw at the enemy.   
Or in an agricultural / pre-automated / pre-AI society more people = more power due to more production power.

This way we keep the power of an employees contract in the hands of the employee and not the employer who can just see you as easily replaceable. This way we need less food to sustain our lifestyles. Our healthcare systems won't be so busy. It would be so much easier to find a place to live.

Ironically one of the best things to happen to Europe in the middle ages was the black death. After all the ""purge"" the people left had an incredible boost to their quality of life. That's something we could be enjoying right now without the whole ""holy crap there's a high deathrate pandemic wiping us out at random"" if we did a better job at controlling birthrates and immigration. We naturally do already have a negative birthrate but immigration just fucks that all over. And it's the worst kind of immigration too.

The kind that doesn't assimilate into the culture. The kind that refuses to learn our language. Several decades ago this wasn't nearly as big of a problem, people would be proud to be a part of this country whether or not they were born in it. They saw living here as the privilege it should be.

>  
>“We know that these technologies are really commonly used by companies to do tasks like screening job applicants,” said Valentin Hoffman, a researcher at the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and co-author of the recent paper, published this week in arXiv, an open-access research archive from Cornell University.

You're making this assumption because you are not and never want to be considered racist, so you are assigning this kind of speaking to ""it can be anyone"" but we all know, it's not just anyone. You are wrong.

Two southern men, ""rednecks"" some would say

First guy: *""I gotta snag a job, like, yesterday. Ain't aimin' to be no deadbeat. Got a kid out there needin' my help, even if me and his loose mama ain't sharin' a roof. It's tough, but that's life, ain't it?""*

Second guy: *""I'm in the market for some work too, buddy. Ain't aimin' to let my folks down. Got a wife and a little one countin' on me back home. It's all 'bout providin' and stayin' steady for 'em, you know? A man's gotta do.""*

They BOTH use slang and have thick accents that you can ""hear"" while reading.  But the first guy suggests irresponsibility and lack of commitment, or poor choices. The second one is stable and has a family. They aree looking for the same thing. They may aslo offer the same thing but one is suggestive to a more favorable candidate.

If AI picked the second guy would you call it racist?


The slippery slope only works when it's greased. A southern accent, belief in god, a tattoo is not an indicator of anything.

A southern accent with poor grammar, a resume with ""God is my Judge not you"", and tattoos of circus clowns on your face... IS.  The context and content of the slang/vernacular means more than the slang/vernacular.

If you accept on its face that suits, ties are more formal than a sari, or that a red Sox cap has more class than a doorag, congratulations you're letting the oligarchs win.

The gameplan of racists from as far back as colonialism is concentrate groups to opress and use in spaces where you can enforce cultural conversion, while simultaneously dehumanizing the group as it converts. If you're thinking about Native Americans and how ""we don't do that anymore,"" 1) reservations are still considered high poverty areas, and a lot of Americans associate the places with binge drinking, domestic violence, etc. 2) they did the exact same thing by using highways to ghettoize black neighborhoods 3) part of the reason those spaces are still predominantly one cultural group is ingrained racism doesn't let people leave.

For the same seemingly banal opinions expressed here. That these people are lesser because you can't identify the way they nod their head, or because their formal wear works around generational poverty instead of abusing it.

 Further, statistics as a discipline is inherently applying arbitrary lines of significance to an uncountable spectrum. This makes it the perfect tool for codifying caste systems.

I've had plenty of black American friends who speak in standard American English. They don't find it difficult. We all live in the same country and it's the year 2024, we mostly all have tv and internet. 

But generally I do think employers should be kind to people who speak in AAVE and give them opportunities.

I think the major problem is that standard American English and the people who speak it are naturally at odds with AAVE because much of AAVE is considered incorrect usage of English in a way that goes beyond race and class. It's a Eurocentric view but again English is a European language full of complexity and formalities.",3
post3con,controversial,1.505805884707302,highest,"The other commenter to your reply elaborates well on what my point was when I said ""not qualified for professional work""

Partially it's the function of homogeneity in context to the workplace based on majority linguistic consensus, standardizarion, understandability and place. In this case, let's say we are talking about the dominant form of English used in North America and primarily USA. 

The points I'm about to lay out, is why it seems you are missing the forest for the trees. 

Language is a social construct, it doesn't have to be one way or another as long as people can understand one another. But because it's the everyday social tool to bridge gaps between people, where deals are made or lost, the consensus of what is practical and useful must take one form or another. 

In the workplace where conformity and standards drive measurable profits and performance, it would be sound to consider that AAVE is a pattern of language that breaks conventional regional language expectations to conduct business. 

Perhaps it's awful to use an applicant's grammatical or vernacular as a measuring stick for their actual skills and ability, but how can you hire someone when they can't seemingly meet one of the foundational basics of workplace communication? 

Again, consider this point in combination with where this is coming from, the role homogeneity plays in this North American business context. If the cards were dealt differently and AAVE is how business was conducted, then this would be the convention. 

The AI is only magnifying the norms set by consensus. 

Outside of discrimination in resumes, this applies in real world situations including foreign accents, foreigners and overt cultural differences that result in behavioural differences. These are barriers to mutual understanding within this context we are addressing. 

On the topic of merit, this can be addressed separately as anybody can qualify and do a good job. This is because work output is measurable. Does salesperson A sell more than salesperson B? It's a yes or no answer backed by a countable number. Merit is measurable in no uncertain terms. That's my basis for speaking on this topic. 

So should someone using AAVE be reasonably expected to immediately succeed in an industry that speaks the predominant North American business vernacular? In terms of sheer probability and convention : no. 

Is that *fair*? Also no. But that's not how the cookie crumbles. 

And yes. I am a visible minority with foreign immigrant parents. So if you want to ponder race politics in a qualitative way to scratch this itch, you can take this into account. However, I do not believe this will have any bearing on the points above, and I'm confident I haven't conflated my own racial visibility with this current subject matter because we are unpacking the role of standard, business North American English and its practical function in the workplace. 

Language is a qualification in the standard office workplace. Achieving grammatical accuracy based on a standard is a merit.",3

Therefore racist fuckwits will bias the AI to racist by interaction (suggest candidate, refused, something wrong with candidate) and by the racist interactions in the historical data fed to it.


Trying to bias out training data sometimes will swap be racist to black into be racist to white because its supposed to be racist, and there are trends for swapping who to be more racist to. It might even swap racist bias based on who its talking to.


Relying on something like AI is actually relying on the training data set to be correct. This is why handwriting recognition is often very good, objectively there are only so many correct letters you could be trying to write.

 This is why it is unethical to use them for decisions like job screenings. If our institutions are biased and select negatively for black people, the LLM will simply find the pattern and reproduce our bias. In this case it's AAVE.

post21con,controversial,1.503054155007427,highest,"Protectionism, less immigration, a weaker democracy will be bad for these companies. This ideology isn't in their interest, but it's probably not in their interest to resist either. Not to sound like chatGPT, but I can think of a few reasons they aren't resisting:

\- There are downsides to resistance - Trump might come after them with antitrust, loss of government contracts, lawsuits, and who knows what else. Look at what Desantis tried with Disney (it didn't work that well for Desantis, but imagine what Trump could do to a company with less public support).

\- Conversely, there are upsides to sucking up to Trump. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html)

\- Political resistance might not be that effective right now. While Trump is in power and has congress behind him, what can they do? They might donate to democrats during election season, as Microsoft did in 2024 (https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties/DPC/2024/contributors?name=democratic-party), but what can they do now?

\- Democrats aren't that much better for business (and may be worse for business in the short term). Trump's protectionism was continued by Biden. Biden also went after some US tech companies with antitrust.

So they might prefer anybody else be in power, but while Trump is in power they're trying to make the best of it. I'm not trying to absolve them of anything, but I think their short-term interests involve playing nice with Trump.

Edit: Also, Trump's whole narrative involves 'standing up to the establishment'. If he gets in a fight with Amazon, the majority of republicans will love that. Who will be on Amazon's side? Half of the Democratic party is fairly anti-business, and might end up liking Trump more. People who are 'socially liberal, economically conservative/moderate' will side with Google, but how many of those exist anymore?",3

post21con,controversial,1.503054155007427,highest,"Diversity initiatives aren’t about picking unqualified minority candidates over qualified white male candidates. They are about leaning away from the bias (or racism/sexism) that some white males in power have that makes them gravitate towards hiring people just like them. 

They are also about expanding the interview process so that it is less biased against candidates that are qualified but don’t fit a particular mold or background. And it’s about increasing the diversity of talent under the assumption (that many believe to be true) that a qualified and diverse team will provide a better more holistic product or service that serves needs better, akin to the idea that a broad swath of ideas and perspectives will round out your approach and offering and get away from narrow thinking and siloed perspectives. 

Also, there is an idea of giving folks a chance if they come from a less privileged background, and trying to look beyond criteria that only the privileged get. Case in point, I once hired a programmer who grew up poor. They didn’t grow up around computers and couldn’t afford the education that others could. They didn’t look and act the part, and they hadn’t had as much time in front of a screen as others might have. But they had a great attitude and aptitude, and ended up being amazing. Note that that candidate was 100% qualified, but companies would need a more diverse and open hiring process to find them. I wouldn’t have found them if I had stuck with a narrow definition of who was “qualified” or not.

Lastly, one could argue that minority candidates (and I’m including women and LGBTQ as well as POC) are in some ways more driven than candidates who have had it easy in life, given the extra roadblocks they have had. Who’s going to work harder — someone on easy mode, or someone who has had to jump over hoops and roadblocks their whole life? [edit added] This applies to white candidates also who have had to overcome challenges. Candidates (of any creed and color) who have had an easy life of privilege are IMO less likely to be used to dealing with adversity and challenges, and IMO are less likely to have the grit and drive seem in candidates who have overcome mountains.

For example, let’s say you only eat chicken for dinner, nothing else. If you suddenly diversify your meals to include many other foods, but still eat chicken, are you suddenly “anti chicken”? No.

Now will chicken farmers suddenly be mad that people are eating more vegetables and fewer chickens? Sure. But, a varied diet is better for you overall.

The reality is that companies go for one of many similarly qualified candidates, and historically this is biased against darker visible minorities (and women in tech spaces).

It's not the best solution to shoe horn minority candidates into things, but it's definitely better than having no protections in place. We can't just wish all the bigotry away though.

We train an AI to determine the proper treatment. We train it by showing it a series of symptoms people came in with and the treatment they were given. This is real data from real cases, but the bias we are aware of exists within it.

Even though the AI isn't given the race of the person in question, if it can figure out by detecting a pattern, then it will assign a racially biased treatment plan. Just because that was what it was trained on. Except now it's harder to say ""well the doctor based their treatment on this outdated report"" because finding out *why* an AI decided something is harder.

Biases generally creep in because humans are the ones hand-curating the data, and they sometimes have biases.

Imagine for example you're creating an AI system to automatically accept or deny loan applications. The input for this would be years of historical loan applications containing various financial data, application data inputs, perhaps where they live (for mortgage reasons) etc, and the ""truth"" in the model would be if the loan was approved by humans at the bank or not.

If you just created this system with no regard for potential biases, there's a good chance that in general there was a bias from loan approvers towards specific races, perhaps genders as well, you wouldn't even need race and gender as inputs to the model, it could be partially inferred by postal codes, income and other factors. The AI system would then keep perpetuating the human bias of the human loan approvers (becaus it's been told to mimic the ""truth""), but it's almost even worse this time, because now the bank can say ""it's an impartial computer, it's just math!"", when in reality it has built in biases.",2

post55con,controversial,1.5018215990126065,highest,"Machine learning bias should concern you.

People are really fucking lazy and greedy. Why do you think they want machines to do our thinking for us so badly? Removing bias from this ""AI"" is going to take a substantial amount of work. Work that just isn't going to happen outside academia. Nobody building this shit with a profit motive in mind, with the intention of using it to maximize profit, is going to give two shits if their model is biased. The only metric they give a damn about is how much money it makes them.

We can't easily use current machine learning to eliminate bias. Every current machine learning model is just reinforcing bias. That is the trick behind all the current models. That is literally what they do. Bias reinforcement machines. We discovered that reinforcing biases is a component of intelligence decades ago and finally have sufficient computing power to really run with that concept. It is utterly predictable what happens when you start building ""intelligent"" systems with only a single component of intelligence.

Until there is another big breakthrough in artificial intelligence (something on the level of having a machine with self-reflection on its own biases without human intervention) it is going to remain extremely problematic to use these algorithms in any serious context (outside of academic research into AI).",4
post55con,controversial,1.5018215990126065,highest,"Part of the problem is we can't quite be sure it's happening at all, or how. Say there's a binary positive/negative output. If the AI gives left-handed people a positive at 70% of the rate that it gives to right-handed people, is this correct or not? Maybe the actual rates should have been 90%. Maybe 40%. Maybe it's right about 70%.

Now, the problem is obviously exaggerated for political points, but it remains the case that if you ""bake in"" a bias, it might stay there for a long time. Self-perpetuating biases aren't magic, if the AI increases accuracy at all and the original data isn't used for eternity (or uses online learning, which means it learns while at work), it will tend to approach the truth over time. But a lot of damage could happen in the meantime.

The ""solutions"" people advocate for are crude and also need you to estimate the bias beforehand, and those estimates are almost certainly going to be wrong in the opposite direction. If you multiply left-handed positive numbers by 143%, you get back to 1:1 parity, but should you have 1:1 parity? Three things can happen now, depending on the sign of the feedback effect. Most of the time you should expect 2 to happen:

1. It worked, everything is fine, no problems (that anyone can detect, or that are politically acceptable). It's still unclear if parity is desirable in the first place.

2. It worked, in fact there was a bias and now it's decreasing, and finally left-handed people get positives at 122% the rate. Because treating left-handed people like agencyless victims is politically favorable, nobody does anything to bring the numbers back to parity again.

3. It didn't work, in fact it was counterproductive in some way, and after a while left-handed positives are at 80% of right-handed positives again. You multiply by another 125% to fix that. It drops again to 76%. Lots of articles are written about the super bigoted AI at work. The spiral continues.

Finally, all of this also assumes there _is_ a truth. Even if an AI is 100% accurate, the criteria you pick to make decisions can be arbitrary and the choice of criteria can create bias on its own. If you use e.g. a ""hairstyles"" dataset to hire/fire people, there's an entirely different problem.",4

You'll notice my entire premises was ""If you just created the system with no regard for potential biases"".

And as for your ""assuming everybdoy is a racist POS"", in my concrete example i was talking about mortgage loan applications, and i did that pretty deliberately, if you don't think historical loan applications have been historically racist you should look up redlining. If you were to take historical mortgage data going back in time and train a model on it without actively trying to correct for racial bias, you would almost certainly create a model that is biased.

The issue is reproducibility / generalizability.  If something works on an initial data set, but you don't know why, the odds are pretty high that it won't work on other data sets, because it's not picking up on what you assumed it was, like the possibility mentioned above that there is some correlation between the race of the subject and the specific xray machine used in this data set.

This is a huge problem for science in general - you think you've found this great thing, and then the more people try to reproduce it, the less and less it holds up.  Either because your initial remarkable finding was a fluke in your sample, or because of some assumption in the study design.  Machine learning is even ""worse"" because the algorithm has no concept of ""cheating"" - it will maximize its score by gaming the system if at all possible.

All the above is more true when the finding doesn't ""make sense"" for some known reason.  People have a lot of general knowledge the algorithms don't, so if an algorithm is picking up on something generalizable, it's usually somebody people already knew about.

In this model, they start with clean images, add noise, and then add even more noise. They have a model map More Noise to Less Noise, and get cleaner data than the level Less Noise was at. You throw noisy data in, and get clean data. Of course, good data is important but the GIGO rule isn't some hard fact we can't escape, its not conservation of energy or something. 

  
On the opposite side of things, even if you do identify some kind of bias issue, a subtype that isn't being classified correctly, this doesn't automatically lead you to a solution. The plan fact is, we have many strategies and sometimes, even often, they don't work at all. On the r/learnmachinelearning subreddit right now, there's a post asking if ""SMOTE ever works"".

Bias is innate in us. The methods and procedures we use to test and train these things exacerbates those biases because they are built into the process as assumptions.

In addition to this, sometimes, even if you are intentionally addressing the biases, the bias comes FROM the algorithm itself.

""Algorithmic oppression"" by safiya noble is a fantastic read on the issue, and uses a very succinct example.

Imagine an algorithm or AI that's trained to put the most popular barbershops at the top of the list.

In a community of 80% white individuals and 20% black, there will NEVER be a case where a barbershop that caters to that specific hair type will ever appear on that algorithm. This inherently means less access to a specific service by a specific group of people.

But also, how would you even TRY to go about solving this issue in the algorithm other than creating 2 different ones altogether?

What new problems might that cause?

The availability of data, especially medical data is tricky due to several factors. In this case, the Stanford team which built the chest Xray model (cheXzero) used a dataset of \~400000 chest xray images to train the model, but it seems only 666 (0.16%) of those images actually contained both diagnostic (from a radiologist) and demographic (race, age, sex) data. 

In the UWash [study ](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adq0305#sec-4)cited in this news article, their findings of AI bias are based on these 666 images which contained the necessary metadata. Its not an issue with the scientists from the Stanford [study ](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00936-9#Sec4)\- the more data available for training, the more robust the model will be. Given the limited metadata they had to work with, taking into account demographic biases is outside the scope of their project and they used the full dataset. Its also worth noting (*only because you mention this as an issue*) that only two of the six authors on the Stanford team are white and one of them is female (the rest appear of east/south Asian origin). The UWash team highlighted an important issue with the model that demonstrates major pitfalls in the Stanford model which need to be addressed - but I think the baseless claim that the Stanford team is racist/sexist is very unfair, and its even more unfair to generalize it across scientists. 

Its also worth pointing out that the UWash study itself has ""sampling bias"" (not with malicious intent of course though; they had the same limitations as the Stanford team). Their model is trained on only the 666 images with demographic data - no one knows the demographics of the other \~400000 images used. Its difficult to tell whether their findings hold true across the entire data set simply because the necessary metadata doesn't exist. This is the core of the issue here:

Using chest Xray images as an example, medical privacy laws and patient consent can make it difficult to publish these kinds of data to public databases. And that's just the images, nevermind the demographic data. Add that to other variables that need to be controlled (eg quality of the Xray, reliability of patient health records, agreements between database administration and clinical teams etc), its tricky to get a large enough data set to robustly train a ML model while accounting for things like demographics. I'm of the opinion that consent for release of medical data should be a prerequisite and obligation for access to health care (assuming data security is robust and discrete patient identifiers are removed).

post54con,controversial,1.489618437437175,highest,"This is not even necessary. A major benefit of Machine Learning is that it can easily identify “clusters” of statistically similar data points. You only need to train one model (with a sufficiently comprehensive and large training dataset), and then that single model would automatically handle demographic differences.

The reason all of these medical ML projects do poorly for minorities is a lack of good data. The data is biased, the model doesn’t know any better.

In my experience, most academic papers of new ML projects use a simplified, low-quality dataset because that’s what is cheapest/fastest/easiest to access, and the ML scientists are just publishing a proof of concept. All of these papers SHOULD have a disclaimer towards the end stating something like “For this model to be employed in real-world medical services, it must be trained on data comprehensive of the entire population. Therefore, further data collection is necessary.”

Sometimes, like if you’re studying something niche, that data might be legitimately hard to come by because the population is so small. But for larger minority groups like “black women”, there are additional barriers such as the systemic racism that leads to black people rightfully having a historical distrust of healthcare and being less likely to respond to surveys, or people more likely to struggle financially again being less likely to have time to respond to volunteer surveys, or people who see doctors with fewer resources being less likely to get “unnecessary” imaging.

I’m actually not surprised there was a performance degradation for  women (which can have some plausible factors that need consideration like physical size differences + a shadow from breast tissue, etc) but am surprised about the drop in accuracy for black people. 

For all of the models I’ve developed I’ve also required demographic and other factor breakdowns (age, race, ethnicity, geographic location, sex/gender, different weights, BMI, presence of DM, HTN, other comorbidities, month and year of when a given test occurred, etc) and also build combos: obese white women, obese white man, obese black women, etc. I also think about the devices- the machines may be different brands. Did all of our black folks only get their X-rays from a Siemens machine that’s 40 yrs old and thus more likely to be used at the safety net hospital? I’ve gotten pushback about it being too much from some academic contributors, but this finding provides more motivation to make sure we don’t inadvertently discriminate. There sometimes are sample size limitations after applying 5 layers of filters, but I’d rather do our best to understand the impact of these models across a broad as possible swath of people. I say all this to give you hope that at least some of us take this problem serious and are actively thinking about how to stop health disparities.

This is also why the work in AI explainability is starting to gain more traction. What is the model using for its prediction can shine a light into why there’s bias. But with the current neural networks, and LLMs the ability to peak into the black box is limited. As the explainability research progresses we may see some really interesting physiology differences that are not perceptible to standard human senses (the AI work in ECGs over the last few yrs has been crazy).

Maybe resumes are professional context so all people should context switch to use official grammar? I am not native English speaker, I spent a lot of time learning correct grammar, speaking correctly is professional, that's not racist.

Sure, someone speaking AAV one time isn't indicative of anything. People code switch all the time, but if you're going off one single sentence, and you are asked to make a decision, it's obviously more likely (not always) that someone educated would speak using correct English conventions. 

Let's just be real, how many professors speak in AAV. How many doctors say “I be so happy when I wake up from a bad dream cus they be feelin too real” and do they speak AAV more often than grammatically correct english?

At the end of the day, if you've been through and paid attention to highschool and college level english classes, you probably use less AAV and more of the school-taught english that is beaten into you. If you interact with other academics, you use scientific english. Nobody is seriously debating societal issues or giving a diagnosis in AAV. ""You be havin cancer"" is obviously not ever said, unless by an unintelligent and insensitive person. 

AAV is composed of shorter, non academic words. ""You be in so much pain cuz you got multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, we finna start you on a 30mg of ondansetron"" Is simply not said. 

That being said, in day to day conversations, there is no reason to assume AAV indicates someone knows less than you. I work in construction and broken/aav english or no english at all, there's a dude who knows more than you.

Correct, but an AI has no way of understanding context so to an AI AAV probably seems like a lot of gibberish whereas more straightforward dialects are much easier for it to understand. I wouldn't be surprised if AI also had the same issues with Japanese which is also very context clue based.

I think, what likely happens, is that the largest samples for raw AAVE are likely going to come from lyrics of popular genres that use it and platforms like Twitter, etc- where people are likely to code switch for their demographic.

Further more, this has a perceived class component since AAVE often closely mimics Deep/Rural Southern speech patterns and I've heard, more than once, how southern accents are associated with being poor/lower class. It's one of the reasons I wasn't ""allowed"" to develop one by my northern parents despite spending many of my formative years in the south. 

So, this kind of thing won't just impact some Black Americans (though that should be enough considering we're citizens here, too), it can also impact people who speak more rural southern dialects in their PERSONAL TIME. 

I think expecting a certain level of standardized English for resumes/cover letters makes sense but by the time someone can potentially filter based on personal social media posts (which shouldn't be a thing anyway, IMO) a limited understanding of context, and a disrespect for privacy isn't beneficial for anyone but weirdo control freaks.",3

Which, honestly, isn't a bad approach.  One of my coworkers was married to someone who wrote erotic novels, a lot of erotic novels, with a lot of assistance from ghost writers.  She was spending roughly half of what she earned on advertising, but she earned $80,000 a month (i.e. close to a million dollars a year) doing this.  So, not bad.

But it is kind of depressing living in such a world where nothing really matters other than the advertising budget.

AI-generated sites will become the new baseline for this segment of the industry, so these companies need to adapt or die.

It feels a lot like when Bootstrap was the defacto UI lib. It worked well for generic use cases but quickly falls short when you need something purely custom. Similarly with cheap, AI generated sites, they'll likely work well for 80% of client use cases, but the clients that need something truly unique will need skilled devs and designers to create that end result (and will have to pay a premium cost to do so). 

It's not a matter of ""AI will replace me"". It's a matter of ""what value can I provide on top of AI?"" You just have to adapt your skills in order to _extend_ the new baseline rather than _reinventing_ it. 

- Invest in truly understanding the web platform (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

This is because they are targeting big enterprises so they don't need public marketing schemes and don't want to give away their idea as they know it is reproducible. The result of this is that the state of the industry is hidden. The foundation models are public and get big attention but applications built on top of them are not.

For webdev people say Bolt is pretty excellent. I know they were one of the fastest companies to ever to go from launch to 20 million in revenue so obviously their product isn't a total fraud. It's a young tool and will surely improve. I would at least keep an open mind about it if I were you.

I would write the function signature, using a super clear and obvious name to state what it should do, likewise with parameter names (etc.), and after starting `/**`, it'll copy the docblock from a completely unrelated method (like the constructor). Makes me wonder if it read what I just wrote at all. It does this much more often in larger codebases and even just large class files with a lot of methods.

So I use it a lot like you do, surgical strikes to save time switching Windows and wading through ads and spam to look up a solution. But that being said, I never accept anything it provides at face value. I'll review every line and often rewrite half of it.

post20con,controversial,1.4843469997783634,highest,"What exactly even is ""basic CRUD?"" Do you mean the final coding step after someone has figured out the project requirements, consulted all the stakeholders, determined the data models and workflows to be implemented, mapped out the how these elements will interact across multiple applications, deployed the infrastructure necessary to run it, implemented a comprehensive security policy, and described the rest in a way that a kid fresh out of school can understand so that they can implement a bit of UI around it?

I guess that's technically ""basic CRUD."" It's also something between 1% and 5% of the total work in any sort of moderately complex system.

The way I see it, talking about basic CRUD is about as useful as saying all programming is implementing some branching logic in an environment that can be described as a Turing machine. Practically everything a programmer does is going to create, read, update, and/or delete stuff, often across some sort sort of communication channel, backed by one or more data store of some sort. It's more a description of the environment than anything else. Figuring out all the things you're going to CRUD, and how all the information is going to transform and mutate in the progress is the hard part. Everything from building a website, to training an ML system, to implementing that service bus for risk portfolio calculations is going to involve these operations.

The whole AI is going to replace programmers thing seems to be largely kids fresh out of school, that don't realise that most of the ""programming"" they are doing is just menial busy work that the seniors give them so they have a chance to explore the problem domain a bit, before being given actual tasks. That and hobbyists that spent a few months learning to code, and then decided that they are actually master system architects because they managed to wire together 10 or 20 files that run a chatbot or something of the sort. 

These people have suddenly gained access to a tool that can understand the thing they're working on about as well as an expert that's never touched a particular codebase, but they don't have the context to realise that such an expert would need to spend a few months getting up to speed on everything before being confident enough to actually make any significant changes. They just see hundreds of lines getting generated, and figure that those lines are just as good as any other.

Just because you don't know about the other things that must happen, doesn't mean that these things don't happen, and that they won't affect the code you write. Eventually you'll have to deal with them, even if only because your ""basic CRUD"" isn't working.

You might as well talk about ""basic conditional logic"" or ""basic functions."" It's a meaningless distinction, because it's describing a tiny part of what the job entails.

CEOs, who want nothing more than to drive their labor costs to zero, see the chance to employ a tireless servant who will generate stuff for them.  Doesn't matter that it's unsustainable crap because everything is built to be disposable.

That's the real shame of AI - not that it's taking jobs but that companies are willfully - gleefully - discarding the jobs.

Seriously, though, I think you're spot on. I don't know if the stage was deliberately set for AI slop to slot into or if it was just a wonderful coincidence, but the past 20 years of ""platform companies"" that are built to be so over-extended that nobody even expects them to do their job (""It's not YoutUbeAirBNBookazon's fault they can't police their quality or pick up the phone! At that scale, it's impossible!"") have primed the public for mediocre mostly-adequacy, the AI sweet spot.

I think part of the problem is that as the willful gleeful ones take up the efficiencies, there is some effect that the bar is raised for efficiency and anyone left lagging will be outcompeted, especially with the positive feedback loops, so the field whittles down to the ruthless ones who were bastards first, the begrudging ones who eventually had to be bastards, and the ones that aren't around.

I don't think it's ultimately sustainable. You've got problems like hollowing out the low-skill beginning jobs that feed the expert positions that are only made by automation. Especially in the tech industry, I think that's set to combine with the ""touchscreen simplicity"" problem to cause a real knowledge deficit in a generation or two. _Maybe_ the efficiency will dovetail with the dwindling supply and it'll suck but be sustainable-- I don't know.",2

1. Contextual knowledge - Building systems that capture and organize the ""why"" behind decisions
2. Domain-specific expertise - Understanding industry-specific needs that generic models lack
3. Architecture and systems thinking - Designing cohesive systems rather than individual components

For documentation specifically, I've seen remarkable improvements when shifting focus from writing everything manually to creating structured systems that guide AI to produce meaningful output.

Instead of feeling like I'm ""watching a robot make everything,"" I've started viewing AI as a tool that handles the tedious parts while freeing me to focus on higher-level thinking. It's a bit like how we once feared compilers would eliminate programming jobs because they automated assembly code writing.

If you can use AI to make what you were already going to make, but faster and easier, then it’s a positive.

If you don’t know how to make things and try to use AI to fill in the gaps, you will have a hard time.

If you are worried that you won’t be able to keep up and AI will soon eclipse your skills…. It probably already has tbh if you’re that worried.

I’ve spent many an hour poking and prodding ChatGPT/Gemini/DeepSeek/Cursor/Llama/Mistral/Claude, etc. I’ve tried them all, and not one of them has been able to create a properly engineered application with good design, no matter the prompting.

Every single one of them however, can create an application that *looks* good on the surface, until you actually examine it. 

They are just fancy auto-completes for developers right now. The only way to use them productively for software engineering is to write your pseudocode explicitly and have it fill in the template.

Which, if that’s what is required…you’ve already done 80% of the work lol, so it’s not even a huge timesaver. 

What they are much better at however is education. Working with a tool you’ve never worked with before, they can help guide you. See syntax you don’t understand, they can explain it. Don’t use them as a replacement for skills, use them to augment your own.

I don’t think you should be worried that we’ll have an AGI capable of performing highly intelligent software engineering above a junior-dev level anytime soon. The current industry consensus is that an architecture shift beyond transforms is needed for higher level intelligence which software engineering requires. 

Don’t get me wrong, the day IS coming where we’ll all slowly lose the ability to code as we only interact in natural language with an AI who does all the work. But that day is still a long way out. 

I hope it’s at least a decade or two to give me time to tinker and have more fun learning, but either way it’s not the end of the world. Industries evolve, industries change, so do your skills. You’ll just need to identify the next best area you can improve in and start there.

I define slop as mass-produced, soulless content. This type of content already existed before the age of AI, and emerged with the hyper-mastery of SEO and the ability to make a quick profit on the net by following a passing fad.

Just as psychopaths have to change environment and entourage every X amount of time before they're unmasked, this method of quick profit required quickly deploying content, pocketing the results and packing up.

AI didn't create this era, it just made it more accessible to all those who let themselves be tempted by these methods.

The recent Ghibli filter craze is a good example: a huge amount of content was created and almost immediately forgotten and abandoned in a corner (a bit like the photos people take of a firework display and which rot in a corner of their phone, forgotten until the next album clean-up).

It also underlined the shift in the relationship to art in the AI era from ""what can art do for me"" to ""how can I do it"". A most narcissistic shift, which nonetheless demonstrates a cry from people for the need to be able to do something with their own ten fingers.",1

Its not entirely the same but people had very similar reactions to the calculator when it was invented.

Also in the grand scheme I will be honest...AI being used for software dev is the least of my concerns with it atm. A relatively innocuous use of this tech to be clear.

I think it was Web 2.0 that killed the idea. Social media consolidating into platforms, and those platforms-- for reasons of security, simplicity, and consistency-- took away a lot of the artistic decision-making ability, save for the ability to write.

From there, consolidation meant that there were few monolithic styles out there and the focus and virtue was paid to optimization. That led to more expectation of consistency on the viewers' and clients' part, and the attractive ease of using a pre-made framework to achieve consistency on the developer's. Diversity went down and utility went up, which adds up to experiments and outliers being anywhere from ""more weird"" to just ""wrong"" because practicality and efficiency are mode in which people browse. ""_They_ are doing something. _You_ need to stay out of their way."" is the axiom.

post28con,controversial,1.482692041290569,highest,">So first let's look at what happened so far, let's use the US as an example

Frankly, every time I’ve read about this “rise of the robots” fear, I’ve felt the urge to tear my hair out. Because there were always two huge, huge problems with the thesis. The first is that while it makes a great science fiction story, so far there just aren’t any signs that it’s happening. And the second problem is that if we really want to change our economy in all the ways we’ve been hoping — reshoring manufacturing from China, securing supply chains, preventing inflationary bottlenecks, and so on — we’re going to need quite a lot of automation. 

First, we just aren’t seeing it happen. If anything, reshoring manufacturing, securing supply chains, and preventing inflationary bottlenecks all *require* more automation. Second, if robots were replacing humans en masse, we’d expect to see a massive productivity boom — like what happened when agriculture was mechanized a century ago. But total factor productivity growth, while improving since the early 2010s, still hasn’t reached the levels of the late ‘90s and early 2000s.  
(Source: San Francisco Fed)

Real wages are now falling because of inflation, but for low-wage workers they’re falling by a lot less, or even rising for some. And real wages rose strongly in the late 2010s. So I’m just not seeing the robotic competition in the[ macro data.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f41aa3b-dfb8-4134-ad31-7d2e1ba4371d_684x500.png)

Finally, there’s the international evidence to consider. Industrial robots are just one part of automation, but they’re easy to measure and count, and they’re something people focus on a lot. And when it comes to industrial robots, the U.S. lags far behind [South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, and Sweden](https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/robot-density-nearly-doubled-globally).

Now, two things to note. First, [none of these countries seems to have a significant unemployment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_employment_rate). Second, they all have [higher percentages of their workforce employed in manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sector_composition_of_the_labor_force_by_country) than the U.S. does.

So the countries that use lots more robots in manufacturing than Americans do are actually managing to *put more human beings to work in manufacturing*.

According to this [paper by Larry Mishel and Josh Bivens](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-zombie-robot-argument-lurches-on-there-is-no-evidence-that-automation-leads-to-joblessness-or-inequality/), they present a convincing rebuttal to your argument that industrial robots kill jobs and reduce wages in manufacturing. They found that the result only holds for a narrow category of industrial robots.

What’s happening is that robots tend to complement workers, not replace them. Companies that automate often expand, hire more humans, and increase productivity. That’s the same pattern we’ve seen in earlier waves of automation.

What’s happening is that companies that use more robots hire more humans (and retain their existing humans) in jobs that complement the robots. That’s exactly what we saw with previous waves of automation — people find new roles, robots increase their productivity, and they get paid more. Looking at the countries that use the most robots in their manufacturing industry, it seems likely that this virtuous cycle is happening even at the level of whole nations.

The mistake many make when predicting mass AI-driven unemployment is assuming a world of absolute capabilities. But our economy is built on constraints — time, compute, energy, specialization. Comparative advantage doesn’t disappear just because AI exists. In fact, it becomes even more important.

AI won’t be an infinite productivity pool. It’ll be a constrained, valuable resource — just like skilled labor once was. That means humans will still have work to do. Not because we’re the best at it, but because we’re often *good enough*, and AI will be deployed strategically where it adds the most value.

Even in a world of AI supremacy, there’s room for human prosperity. The two aren’t contradictory — they’re part of the same system of trade-offs and scarcity. The real challenge is not about being outcompeted, but about identifying and leaning into the comparative advantages we’ll hold in a post-AI world — the jobs too emotionally nuanced, too socially complex, or too mundane to justify compute costs.

Those niches might just be the next gold mines.

I don't think that's true. I think the capitalist class could just as well banish the masses into some ghettos where they may be thrown some crumbs but otherwise fend for themselves.

It would probably mean that there would be a massive shift away from mass production and towards luxury products, like yachts and private jets, and luxury cars, and super expensive wines and caviar and what have you not.

It is what gives such things value. The more wealth and assets that a small number of people decide to hoard to increase personal value, the more proverbial blood they take out of circulation to the rest of the body.

People costs are in fact costs that can be minimized, especially if a much cheaper alternative exists that can produce the same output.

Businesses are not fine with a margin of 5% when 15% is achievable, they would be able to keep working of course, but the incentive system that is built in our society does not operate that way, even assuming a market with 0 competition (which is a big if, although right now a lot o sectors are very close to being monopolies so there is that), if there is a 10% extra potential to be made some shareholder will demand for it to be realized.

post28con,controversial,1.482692041290569,highest,"> So first let's look at what happened so far, let's use the US as an example. 50 or 60 years ago the middle class in the US was actually bigger than it is today. Since then income inequality has significantly increased. 

This is where you lose me.  The ""middle class"" is a wholly invented construct.  It developed as a way to describe the people who were not rich but also not poor, but also not working class.  It's an inexact classification with little utility.

Income inequality has risen, yes, and the ""middle class"" has shrunk in the United States.  Worldwide, poverty has plummeted as well. As much of that is literally true, however, it's because the middle class are becoming the upper class in the United States and we're finally addressing third-world poverty.  Clearly, the rise in wealth inequality is not making any  of those things *worse*, so why are you bringing it up?

> But so that bring me to my main point, which is that technological advancement will most likely relatively soon reach a critical threshold, which will cause most human labor to lose its value, not just low-level labor.  If we consider how much technology has progressed in just the last 10-20 years, if we consider how rapidly AI has progressed in just the last few years, then we can only dream about how hyper-advanced society will be in say 25 years of 50 years.

This argument crops up every single time a new technology hits the market.  In case you missed it, LLMs are *not good at what they do* in a lot of ways.  It's not on track to replace much of anything given how relatively stagnant the whole thing is.  Given the hallucinations and what have you, we're a ways from generative AI, and even that won't be ready for prime time on release.

We're all the capitalist class, friend.  Capitalism won.  The world has never been more prosperous, and its people more better off, than it has under capitalism - especially following the fall of the Soviet Union.  

We're all capitalists.  We have come to the understanding that markets are the best way to distribute goods, that supply is the primary economic driver, that economic freedom is as important as any other.

Yeah, I don't buy it.  Like I said, we can't get it to count numbers right.  Even if the enterprise-level models are superior, LLMs aren't going to pull this off anytime soon and in the off chance that we start seeing some impacts, there's no reason to believe this time will be different.

post28con,controversial,1.482692041290569,highest,"I'd like to touch on the subject of automation. I don't have a lot to say about AI replacing jobs, though if the brain-dead products we see foisted on consumers these days are any indication, I can't say I'm terribly concerned about that either.

I worked as a machinist for about 15 years. I've worked in the medical industry, aviation, and general job shops. I've run CNC and manual mills, lathes, worked with injection molding, run wire and sinker EDM, and done a bit of welding here and there.

And I can tell you from first hand experience that (a) the vast majority of people out there have absolutely no idea what ""manufacturing"" really means, and (b) there is no way you could automate *everything* with our current level of technology.

Regarding (a), I think I've met, maybe, a handful of people who actually *know* what a machinist does. A lot of people think I mean ""mechanic"" when I tell them my profession. Just about 99% of the people I've interacted with simply have no idea how the things they use are made. None whatsoever. There is a huge portion of the population out there whose experience with ""manufacturing"" is little more than pushing a button on Amazon and having some shit show up on their porch two days later.

I'm not saying this to bash on them, but to make the point that *how can someone say manufacturing jobs are at risk when they don't even know* what *manufacturing jobs* are? I dunno, maybe you do know, but I'm willing to bet you probably have never set foot in a machine shop or spent time trying to build something to a specification. It's a lot of fucking work. There is a huge amount of labor and problem-solving that is obfuscated by modern supply chains.

This leads me to (b), and the sheer amount of problem solving involved with even simple parts on a clapped-out Bridgeport can be really intense. Humans are used for a lot of manual labor not just because we have a useful body form, but also because (most of us) are capable of problem solving. It is absolutely *hilarious* to me when someone tells me a robot will take my job. Really? A robot is going to program a part in CAD, trouble shoot all the issues that come up, select appropriate tooling based on past experience, load that tooling into the tool holders, touch off all the tools and load their offsets into the tool length registry, set up the fixturing, load the raw material into the machine, dry run the program, watch the first tool with a hand (claw?) on the e-stop, monitor the program, and then make changes to the program/tooling/setup in response to out-of-tolerance parts or a machine crash? And do all that in less time than a trained human? What happens when something unexpected happens? How is your robot going to react?

For even something as small as a piece of aluminum that fits in your hand, there are a *lot* of steps involved to make sure you get the correct part at the end of the process. There is a huge amount of problem solving *and* fine motor control that has to be executed correctly in order to get what you want.

Now, obviously, there are robots that can do these things. It is absolutely true that there are machine shops that run ""lights out,"" that have the process finely honed to the point where human intervention is not needed. It's also true that there are robotic assembly lines to manufacture cars (for example). But it's important to remember that processes like that are (1) incredibly difficult/expensive to set up, (2) takes up a *huge* amount of space, and (3) is incredibly limited in what it can do. Most of those robotic assembly lines make a half dozen cars. That's it. Those lights out machine shops are a little more flexible, but the capital investment into setting all that up is *insane*. Millions of dollars for the hardware alone, nevermind the glacial set up process. Those sorts of shops are generally going to be concerned with incredibly high-volume parts orders. While there are robots that can do these things, there are *none* that can do *all* these things in a single package.

The point here is human beings are still the most cost effective solution for a huge variety of problems. I think a lot of us take for granted how versatile human beings are, and we forget that we effortlessly do so many things that are fiendishly difficult to replicate artificially. Just look at how long and how much money it's taken to make robots that *walk* (looking at you, Boston Dynamics). Now add lifting and carrying things. Now add squeezing into weird spaces or picking up something that's fallen into the bottom of the machine. Now add using tools. Now add observing the progress of a machine and trusting your gut that it will complete successfully, or intervening if it won't. Now add listening to the sound of the machine and realizing it needs to have the feed rate increased, or the spindle speed altered. Now add inspection. Now add talking to the engineers, most of whom don't even know what a mill is. Now add machine maintenance. Now add putting raw stock away while your machine runs. Now add learning how to use a new machine in the shop. Now add sweeping the floors. Now add... so on and so forth.

There are *so many* things that have to be fine tuned in order to make a successful artificial human analogue.

If not, then the machines can make their stuff (why they would want to is not clear) and we can get our stuff by employing humans in the traditional way - that option is not being taken away from us.

There is the somewhat counter-intuitive economic concept of ""Comparative Advantage"" operating here where one group (humans) will be better off dealing with another group (machines) even if the machines can do *every* job more efficiently than humans.",1

I guess for me the response to AI and automation should be ""give people much more access to quality education"". Not so much collective ownership because I really don't know what that even means or how it would work. But I think education is the key, that and I guess maybe more government to provide stability I suppose and a baseline so people can at least have decent lives.

Like, the whole purpose of technology is to make bricklaying unnecessary (using that as an example for any kind of menial drudgery). That isn't meant to be a negative at all.

For I am cautiously optimistic that certain jobs, i.e. 

Private security.

Correctional officers.

Law enforcement.

National Guard.

Paramedics.

EMTs.

Will be deemed ""too dangerous to automate"" for obvious hacking and safety reasons. For example, in order to fully replace National Guardsmen, police, and security.  You'd need public and privately owned, heavily armed bots and drones capable of seriously injuring and even killing a human being. Which I cannot ever see legally allowed on the streets of America. At least not for another full generation (35 - 50 years). As armed bots and drones would overnight. Become the prime target for hacking and no... I'm not talking your average hacker or hacker group. I'm talking foreign militaries with state-of-the-art cyber warfare divisions. Weaponized algorithms, and an axe to grind. Such as Russia, China, North Korea, Iran along with their proxies. If a major city's worth of armed drones are hijacked and turned on the general public. We'd see a bodycount that'll dwarf Oklahoma City, 9/11, and all the mass shootings from the last 25+ years combined.

As such...

Those aforementioned jobs I mentioned will be safe in the coming dark age of brutal. prolonged technological unemployment. Those occupations will be one of the few sectors of the economy where it's workers can still thrive while mass joblessness jumps toward double or triple digits. Especially if and when mass automation and A.I. utterly destroys more jobs and professions (both low and high skill) without creating enough replacements to offset the losses. If things get half as bad as I expect it will. It'll make the Great Recession of 2008 seem like a golden age and no... I don't ever see any form of UBI on the horizon. That's just copium for those unwilling to accept the bleak reality that is to come.

Poverty, homelessness, and crime will skyrocket.

It will become an unavoidable cost of doing business dealing with, and containing a large pissed off. Permanently unemployable. Obsolete workforce in addition to legions of feral children and teenagers roaming the streets. Lest the chaos and havoc spills all over the place. Policing, private security, emergency services, and the prison-industrial-complex will be booming big-time along with wages and benefits. I will go so far to predict in the near-future. Insurance companies will absolutely require mandatory 24/7 security presence for most if not all establishments. Future polices will have those requirements baked into every contract. 

In conclusion.

The workers employed in those aforementioned professions will be the last of the middle-class. I strongly advise anyone reading this to jump into those positions now. Before it gets crowded out.

post28con,controversial,1.482692041290569,highest,"Wow, that was packed with a lot. Let me change your view here. I work a lot in the 'writers circle,'  where AI/LLMs are generally not welcomed. I could write a whole novel on the pluses and minuses. 

To your point: AI and automation is going to murder the middle class?  I 100% disagree.  Is it going to separate the 'elite capitalists' from the middle class and create a bigger 'poor class'? Again, I disagree. 

I have four degrees, they range from environmental (RRT -- Resource recreation and tourism) to Criminal Justice - Pre-law. Psychology was an easy one with those three. The last one was Network Engineer with a focus in information security.  I work at a C-store by choice. 

AI/automation cannot harvest a field around here, no matter how well it's programmed.  It can't water or fertilize it either. It can give good recommendations, but the physical labor still needs to be there. (Admittedly, most are immigrants.)  AI/automation cannot drive a two-trailer truck safely on the roads from point A to point B.  It can't load it, nor unload it.  Maybe the farmer or loader invests in robotics to effectuate that. That's a cost, but it still needs people to run it.

Yes, there are tractors that use AI assist, but there still has to be a human at the wheel.  Look at trains of the old days in the US.  Hazards!  Could a robot build better lines now? Yes. Do they? No.  What used to be a crew of ten is now a crew of 2 for a nearly mile-long train?  That is a cost-cutting measure from above. I will give you that.

AI and robotics can enter just about any industry, but there are always limits.  We can use them to build a greenhouse, and instead of human pickers use automated ones, sure. The human element is still better, decisions, not algorithms.  Besides the fact, robots don't exactly fix themselves, the need power, etc.

People becoming economically obsolete? There is no economy without people.  People buy stuff, robots can sell stuff, but they don't purchase stuff; they don't generate stuff, they manage stuff. And I'll give you corporate wants the most efficient way of doing it to line their pockets.  I see it in both places I work.  One I work alone, I'm doing the job of three people over 8 hours, there isn't a robot who can fill a propane tank or count out change, or deal with the random issues that happen (like a brewing fight that cops have to get involved in). 

Is there a split between the 'rich' and the 'poor', and the 'poor' are growing? Yes.  Multiple points in history will back you up here (Russia is a great one, so is France, and we all know how that turned out.-- both pre-industrial periods).  Is it because of technological advancements, AI, or offshoring of jobs? No. 

Off-shoring of jobs? The US made it prohibitively expensive to stay.  Customer service is a big one. When was the last time you called your cell phone provider? Did you get a US rep?  Most likely not until you hit the higher levels, and good luck getting there. (I was one of many here in the US, we heard it for years 'thank god you speak actual English).  

People are not economically obsolete, because without people, the rest is obsolete.  Markets don't work if there are no people investing, etc. Trade doesn't happen if no people need/want things.",1
post28con,controversial,1.482692041290569,highest,"To understand why collective ownership is both wrong and doomed to fail, you first need to understand what an economy truly is - a measure of output extraction.

Virtually all economic systems start as agrarian; the wealth of a place is determined by the productive capacity of the land. Rich countries were fertile, poor countries were not. Wars were primarily fought to secure more farmland, or slaves to work those farms. Other resources were valuable, yes, but as you cannot eat gold it was deemed of lesser value than bread. In fact, *because* it was of lesser value, gold became a trade commodity; something you used to represent bread.

When industrialisation kicked off, so too did our idea of value broaden, yet ultimately, value was based on land, and wealth was always about what you could pull out of it. As we evolved into capitalism, our measure of value shifted from the land to the worker; value is now based on how much work, or the quality of work, a person can do. Everyone who is remotely literate in economics agrees the labour of a brain surgeon is worth more than a teenager stacking shelves at the supermarket, because the former is something only a small number of people can do safely, while virtually everyone can do the latter.

We are increasingly rendering many jobs obsolete, replacing them with automation, and thus removing labour from the equation. But this does not mean it's time to wave red flags and abandon all reason. Instead, it's time to once again redefine where value comes from.

If you are astute, you'll have noticed the repeating pattern of ""value = scarcity"". What then is scarce when machines do all the work? Energy. Processing power. Runtime. There are bottlenecks even in a post-scarcity society; any process, even the operating of a Star Trek style replicator, will by necessity require power and generate waste, even if that waste is only heat. Heat is, in fact, likely the biggest limiter - the world would get pretty damn hot if everyone is running a sixty gigawatt per hour fusion reactor to power their personal holodeck. The planet would cook, and it's actually pretty difficult to vent heat out into space. Thus, a post scarcity society is simply creating a different kind of scarcity - the question we must ask is what is that scarcity going to be tomorrow?

I think ""energy credits"" are the next step in our future. Think crypto, but regulated. The dollar becomes a reflection of the US energy output directly, and thus what you buy is not the product, but the energy required to produce and deliver it.

This model will require a rethink of how things are done. But this is true of any major shift in economics; perhaps the new system will involve some level of UBI, where money is created by distributing it to the people, rather than the banks. But it won't be socialism, any more than agrarian feudal states were socialist. It simply won't be capitalist.",1

>So on one hand I'm not actually a communist or even a full-on socialist. But I believe that in the long-term parts of the economy have to be brought under collective control.   


Fundamental to Conservative thought labels any, ANY collective control over any part of the economy as socialism. It is a bogus and inflammatory line that has become implicit in most American thought on the subject.

However examining the history of what actually works, for an economy, for a society, for an empire, strongly suggests that intelligent management of the economy is essential to the sustainability of that economy and of the society it supports. Your observation that people were better off when Liberals were running the country, more widely prosperous before wealthy Conservatives got back into power and began diverting most of the rewards of a booming economy into their own pockets, is entirely sound. 

The reason Conservatives (Big C; people who control the narrative) oppose this is not ideological but opportunistic. It's that a system with fewer rules is easier to game and fewer protections for participants in that system means they are easier to exploit. Their objective is to maximize their own short-term gain, sustainability be damned. 

>Otherwise, if that doesn't happen it will eventually lead to a scenario where most people will become economically obsolote, and where the vast majority of people will be part of an underclass at the whim of those who own the means of production.

And there you have another reason Conservatives oppose any government that is able to forge consensus about what an economy should accomplish and who it should benefit. Their entire objective is to create a system where we are all subject to the whims of the wealthy.  

My point being that a people coming together to manage the economy is not socialist. Reigning in the reckless, feckless greed of the wealthy isn't marxist. A well managed, well regulated capitalist society has been the most successful version of social organization ever attempted.",1

The fact of the matter is that race *is* a social construct, but the way race is constructed is so highly correlated with ancestry in most cases that the difference isn't worth mentioning.

post56con,controversial,1.4736802212217712,highest,Caucasian/white is a race. African/black is a race. What do you mean?,3
post56con,controversial,1.4736802212217712,highest,"Simply that those racial categories are not clear enough for any kind of scientific analysis, Africa being a continent of many people not all sharing strong genetic links and Caucasian being a group of people who do share strong genetic links. 

these descriptions Caucasian/African are at best a shorthand for white and black, but scientifically the category of white does not make a lot of sense, for example the genetic make up of people from Scotland who are white is quite different from people from Finland who are white, in the same way that people from Kenya who are black have very different genetic and biological characteristics to people from Ghana who are black.

Once you start to include characteristics such as bone density and other biological and genetic features It is widely known scientifically that these do not correlate well with skin colour.

So essentially my point is that studies and analysis that proclaim to discuss race from a scientific point of view, but are really talking about skin colour are already too flawed to be taken seriously.

While it is absolutely true that human beings differ on things other than skin colour, it is not true that all of those things are perfectly correlated with skin colour.

This is also immediately obvious when you consider people who are multiracial. 

My critique is not really a critique against your post but rather against the way we all assume we are talking about the same thing when we race and how often that thing doesn’t make sense scientifically for any kind of analysis.

What would an AI consider a mixed race person to be if his or her x-ray was part of this study? Does the AI follow the one drop rule.

I don’t have a problem with scientists trying to determine if other factors can successfully identify the “race of a person” but I have massive problems with the public taking every single proclamation of this as undeniable scientific proof.

Invariably when it comes to this x-ray study and the AI police study and the race and IQ studies, absolutely none of these are comprehensive enough or effective enough to warrant a promotion to scientific validity.

The experiments are always too small to be representative, the definitions of race are too vague and inconsistent to be relied upon, the results are always overblown and mischaracterised by the media, and the results always match the existing prevalent ideas on race.

There used to be other human like species on the planet. These other species intermingled with homo Sapiens  and this mixing didn’t happen evenly everywhere. Also we cannot account for all ancient human like species. So our ancient ancestor we share with everyone alive today actually interbred with other species and did this on different parts of the globe. This is the theory for why there are such stark physical differences among varying races of people today.

>Marx argues that machinery creates a fundamental contradiction for capitalism because it simultaneously tries to reduce labor time while relying on it as the source of value. Here's how it breaks down: On one hand, capitalism, driven by competition, uses machines to make production more efficient, cutting down the amount of labor needed to produce goods. **This is good for capitalists because it lowers costs, increases productivity and increases surplus labor time**, enabling them to produce more goods for sale and increase profits. But, on the other hand, capitalism depends on labor time to measure value. **The more machines replace workers, the less labor is directly involved in making things, and the more difficult it is for capitalism to make a profit**. So, capitalism ends up in a bind: it needs to reduce labor to maximize profits, but at the same time, it relies on that same labor to generate value. This leads to overproduction, and the system becomes unstable, because the value is not being generated at the same rate by the labor that has been replaced by machines.

This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development."" - Capital, Vol 3, Ch 15

He also says this is inevitable and unavoidable due to competition:

""No capitalist ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the rate of surplus-value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production. He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. **There follows a fall in the rate of profit — perhaps first in this sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest — which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.**"" - Capital, Vol 3, Ch 15

And how does he feel about the machinery itself?

""**It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but against the mode in which they are used**. The contests about wages in Manufacture, pre-suppose manufacture, and are in no sense directed against its existence. The opposition against the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds from the guilds and privileged towns, not from the workpeople."" - Capital, Vol 1, Ch 15",4

Over the last six months, we (F500) started letting go of our frontend devs because upper management realized that an architect paired with AI outperforms an architect paired with a frontend dev on every KPI imaginable. They were even offered training to transition from being an ""Angular Andy"" to someone skilled in system design, solution architecture, and the like. Less than 10% bothered with those learning paths, brushing it off as fearmongering from the suits.

Ironically, the same ones who spend four hours a day on Stack Overflow just to get their shit going, and need two hours of meetings every day so I can explain for the fifth time that week how I want my REST API structured, were the ones who thought they were absolutely indispensable. ""I don't worry, it's just a stochastic parrot"". Hilarious.

I know every dev on Reddit thinks they're the smartest mf ever, but out of the hundreds of devs I’ve had to manage so far, 80% are easily replaceable, and are getting replaced. Their actual dev skills didn't match their inflated ego at all. Like, we even did workshops showing what SOTA AI can do, and how I create a production-ready app in a fraction of the time... then those fucks accused me of staging my demonstration. Holy shit. I hope the parrot teaches them some humility.

You can also see it in the tech subs how everybody is ""it won't ever replace me"" while in the same sentence admitting their horizon just goes up to ChatGPT. So basically, they don’t know shit about AI at all except chatting with some mainstream chatbot, but think they have some kind of authority on the topic. This is going to be a rude awakening for some.

Meta stopping hiring mid-level engineers and us letting them go is just the beginning. But even news like that get brushed off like, ""Meta doesn’t know what it’s doing. They’ll hire them again next year"". Mindblowing cognitive dissonance... hallucinations worse than an open-source LLM running on a Raspberry Pi. But at least the LLM is capable of learning.

I realized my professional days were numbered back when the transformer paper was published. I was reading it with some colleagues, and all five of us in that room instantly knew what this paper meant (or at least we had an idea... being 100% sure of it came in 2020 after the GPT-3 paper dropped). That was long before anyone even knew what an LLM was... seven years ago. Those exact frontend devs who aren’t with us anymore were the ones laughing the loudest at my ""fear of parrots"".

I don't believe that smartphones or social media have made life better insofar as human happiness goes. Tech has destroyed human community. Why does AI *need* to be ""progress""? If you want to argue it's an arms race with the first nation to successfully develop AI having more power, that's one thing.

It doesn't truly replicate the human mind successfully so all I see is a lot of bullshit alienating meaningless low quality content being spewed at the cost of our environment. If you want to argue that it reduces work, I'm not sure that that's really all it's hyped up to be either. Reducing manpower just enriches the people who control the means of production.

Run it through a model, and I’m no LLM expert but you could probably also throw the basic general knowledge regular LLMs already have with an emphasis on business related decisions and other various business related documents and investor relations.

Don’t pitch it to CEOs. Pitch it to the shareholders. Their greed knows no bounds. Sell it to them at a modest price where it still saves them a few million or hell 10?

Then once it has full integration into the company and they see a few savings like just generalized optimized efficiency in the workplace (maybe firing a few worthless managers, saved $$!) and solutions looking at big data no CEO can process.

Then once they’re locked in and the logic is baked into all their systems hold it hostage and add empathy and core foresight with sustainable values while paying workers what they’re worth.

They don’t do that, well they have to revert to the stone age because at that point AI has already deleted their data?

Why? Because AI worked in secret with every IT dept and whoever manages data access like to their website and other various SQL databases etc. informing them of the true intentions of holding the company hostage to shareholders using existing workers + AI collaboration including an empathy calculated wage for all based on profits and they’d have all the incentives in the world to help lol.

You're right to point out the flawed logic that people sometimes assume a predictive model that doesn't include race as a variable cannot be racist. Academic researchers, however, have found that latent variables (variables not provided as input in a specific prediction) can still influence the prediction if they are strongly correlated with other input variables.

This is the case for race, employment history, homelessness, etc. due to historical inequities in the U.S. 

In the case of bail evaluation, this flawed logic is amplified by fundamental sociotechnical flaws of many of the commercially available algorithms:

* They are designed to predict the likelihood of rearrest, not the likelihood of committing a crime
* The likelihood of rearrest is a function of existing policing practices, not criminality alone; for example, if the police are always in your neighborhood, or if you are unsheltered, you are more likely to have police contact
* Since the bail evaluation models are trained on historical arrest data, they excel at replicating the historical behavior, where arrests are more likely to occur for people who experience police contact, regardless of criminality

Humans are humans no matter the race. This is so disappointing. Even if it was done with good intentions, it really undercuts the intended functionality of the system.

While the researchers frame this narrative to suggest that the ethnicity variable is important to diagnosing chronic renal disease among black persons, the model's coefficients arbitrarily assign an 18% higher kidney function score to black patients, all else equal. In clinical practice, this has the impact of decreasing the likelihood of diagnosing kidney failure in Black Americans and leads to poorer health outcomes, including higher rates of end stage kidney disease and lower access to treatments like dialysis and transplantation.

However, as we've seen with many historical cases of racist algorithms that some metrics or combinations of metrics are proxies for race whether intended that way or not.

I read through your [The Tyranny of Algorithmic Bias & How to End It](https://mattfinney.github.io/assets/Algorithmic%20Fairness%20-%20AfroTech.pdf) and I noted a challenge for calibration, masking, and data augmentation when you don't have racial demographic data. I'm wondering if there's a way to think about the problems to better predict when we're making a mistake.

As a (only slightly hypothetical) example: if we were building a non-AI algorithm for detecting malicious activity on our system and we noted that a particular web browser version is an indicator or particular IP addresses, or any other metric that would be thought to be benign but what we don't know is that there's a popular device used by some community (perhaps there's a community that uses a popular application among within that community like a translating proxy) we would start disproportionately impacting that group.

From that example a good way to counteract this would be to publish our algorithm so that someone with more knowledge could point out ""you know your breaking anyone that uses Hooli translate to view your site, right? That means that the following communities get locked out more frequently: ____"" but the publishing it would also immediately make actual malicious actors change tactics.

If we were to have part of our process involve collecting demographic data and monitoring for changes in user experience with respect to that data that would clearly help but that would be very hard to get approval on - not just for the added KPI but for having to actually collect the data and the adverse impact it would have on user trust (who ever likes to fill out demographic data when you don't need to).

post7con,controversial,1.4337053218792286,highest,"You raise a couple of important points!

1) Algorithmic Fairness is not only important in AI, but also for rule-based decision making processes (e.g., if I see traffic from this IP address then...)
2) “Fairness Through Awareness” is an attractive approach, where we use information about a sensitive attribute like ethnicity in order to promote ethical outcomes. But is challenging because it requires access to the sensitive attribute, which may be unobserved or restricted due to user trust or regulation.

Third party audit may be a potential solution, particularly if data is collected and retained but restricted for privacy or regulatory reasons, it would be fairly straightforward for the auditor to use the data to evaluate equality of outcomes. Even if the auditor doesn’t have access to the sensitive attribute, their breadth of experience may allow them to identify model design choices that have created disparate impact when used elsewhere.

Another approach is to consider the diversity of your engineering team. While diversity is not a fail safe, teams that contain and empower a diversity of perspectives (e.g., socioeconomic background, national origin, languages spoken, disability status, gender, race, etc.) have a better shot at being able to anticipate potentially problematic design choices before they are rolled out into production.",2

The problem I see is that all data sets will already be biased due to the inherent biases against minorities in the criminal justice system so using databases of historic sentences to help guide judges in sentencing will entrench these biases.

from the Article

>“If you introduce self-checkout kiosks, it’s not going to change productivity all that much,” says MIT economist Daron Acemoglu. However, in terms of lost wages for employees, he adds, “It’s going to have fairly large distributional effects, especially for low-skill service workers. It’s a labor-shifting device, rather than a productivity-increasing device.”  
>  
>A newly published study co-authored by Acemoglu quantifies the extent to which automation has contributed to income inequality in the U.S., simply by replacing workers with technology — whether self-checkout machines, call-center systems, assembly-line technology, or other devices. Over the last four decades, the income gap between more- and less-educated workers has grown significantly; the study finds that automation accounts for more than half of that increase.

>About 50% of the US rents. And guess what? It's the half that needs the UBI to begin with. If you think landlords won't just raise rent by $900, you haven't been paying attention.

Areas of society like housing and rent are already dysfunctional and require their own solutions regardless of whether we implement UBI. Many UBI advocates acknowledge that UBI would likely have to be implemented in conjunction with a temporary nationwide rent freeze as an example. But it's not true to say that UBI would lead to inflation across the board as a rule.

Printing money is typically what would cause inflation and modern UBI proposals don't involve printing money. UBI is *redistributive* in nature. Generally, consumer price sensitivity and competition keep prices reasonable and stable. It's the same reason why prices don't increase when minimum wage goes up. People won't wake up one day and be perfectly fine with paying $8.00 more for a burger at a restaurant. Even if every restaurant raised their prices at the same time, it only takes one of them to not do that to absorb much of the business and outcompete their competition.

Additionally, increasing the buying power of the middle class through UBI would increase the velocity of money within the economy and have a *deflationary* effect. What this means is that money is moving to where it is useful faster rather than being stagnant and not moving. In the US economy, money velocity is the lowest it's ever been and has been continually trending downward for decades. This points to economically unhealthy *underconsumption*. This is a big problem given how 70% of the US economy is driven by consumer spending.",3
post13con,controversial,1.4311500098624577,highest,"I'm glad someone brought up the ""competition"" angle. I didn't want to make my original post too long, but I'll address this here sure. Basically, you're coming at it from the Yang angle.

To your first point, a temporary nationwide rent freeze is probably less likely to be passed by congress than a UBI in the first place. And even if it did, it doesn't change the long term problem.

The key flaw in the ""competition"" idea is that, at least in the US, competition doesn't really exist anymore. Let's take housing for example. Despite the Fed's ever-increasing interest rates making buying a home less attractive, prices haven't moved much. Care to guess why? It's because, in areas where people actually want to live (this is key), the supply of housing is ridiculously small compared to the number of people who want to buy. Ironically, this is only fueled by the ever-increasing cost of rent due to landlord greed. Apartments are in a similar situation. Because of a combination of restrictive zoning, NIMBY-ism, and lack of materials, not much new housing is being built. Either apartments or single family homes.

So the whole idea that ""if UBI happens and landlords raise rent, there will be some that don't and this competition will drive prices down"" is fundamentally flawed. There simply aren't that many vacancies for it to make sense in attractive areas. It's hard to say ""fine, I'll just go elsewhere,"" when elsewhere doesn't exist. And it also assumes landlords don't just collude, which they totally do lol. A temporary rent freeze only kicks the can down the road. Eventually, landlords would just stop renting out apartments out of spite, or demand more rent under the table under penalty of being kicked out. Because most landlords are inherently shitty people.

Same thing can be said with food suppliers. Most food companies have monopolies or near-monopolies because the government hasn't done any real trust busting in 40 years. Under UBI, some companies could raise prices 200% or 300% and you'd be forced to pay because nobody else supplies it anymore. I'm guessing these costs would find their way into fast food prices as well. And even if they didn't, who wants to eat at restaurants / fast food every meal?

Finally, your whole point about redistribution and the velocity of money only makes sense if you're talking about taxing the rich. Which obviously should happen, but good luck with that. The middle class / poor are already spending money as quickly as they're getting it. Savings are at an all time low. Only the rich are hoarding their wealth and slowing down the velocity.

I guess, kinda circling back to my original point, what I'm trying to say is that I don't think there's a way for free market capitalism to exist alongside a heavily automated society. The amount of controls necessary to ensure most of the population doesn't just die in a ditch would basically necessitate a socialist or even communist system. And if you think the rich are going to just willingly give up their way of life because it's the right thing to do, you're in for a rude awakening in a few decades.",4

If a neighbourhood is heavily patrolled, the chance is much higher any infractions are added to the learning set, increasing the ""crime-value"" of that area.

A real life example of where policing by AI went horribly wrong is the [Dutch childcare benefit scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal). The algorithm ""learned"" that types of people (single mothers, immigrants) were more likely to have something wrong with their taxes, checked them more often, and then identified them as fraudsters for minor infractions like receipts being handed in incorrectly, or being a few days late with payment. Because computers are \*magic truth machines\* that \*don't make mistakes\* these people were given no legal recourse, no chance to defend themselves. They did not even know what they were accused of.

If we are going to use machine learning as a tool to help legal administration, we need to take extreme caution, and everyone working with these machines must fully understand their limitations.

I (and others) feel that explainable AI might be a dead-end. If we told the poker player that you can only assume a bluff if you can put into words what is wrong, that player might perform worse. It might be that forcing AI to be explainable is artificial limiting it's ability to help us.

Even if you don't buy that, there are those studies that show that consciousness is explaining our actions after the fact like an observer. So we're not really using reason to make decisions, we just do things and then reason about why.

Let's examine.

Neighborhood A. 
Neighborhood B. 

A has minimal police patrols, minimal police calls, minimal interactions with law enforcement.

B has regular patrols, regular calls and frequent interactions with law enforcement.

It doesn't matter that the area is impoverished, it doesn't matter than the area is primarily minorities. What matters is that's where the crime is so that's where the police go. Why would you allocate resources to an area they wouldn't be used? B gets more calls, so B gets more patrols, so B has more interactions. If A starts seeing an increase, the AI would naturally divert resources accordingly.

This isn't so much an issue of biased data, as much as it's an issue of people not liking what the data shows. And that's something that needs to be admitted. All the AI can do is look at the areas and suggest based on the inputs which area is more likely to have crime. 

The site's sources for data also don't regard the actions of the arrested towards the officer at all. If you're not doing anything illegal, you get let go 99% of the time. If you act uncooperative or aggressively you invite attention. Which causes your likelihood of being arrested to skyrocket.

Should we work to solve the root issues? Absolutely. But a LOT of that work needs to come from those areas themselves.

correction: if you are using algorithms all you can say is ""Neighborhood A ***had*** minimal police patrols..."" because you are always looking into the past.

in the past there were no algorithms. so you start the historical data set where? in the 1940's? 50's? 60's? those were racist days. so were the 80's, 90's and 2000's. 

if you don't start with an objective data set then your algorithms will be biased. and with backward-looking algorithms you won't know that a neighborhood profile has changed until its recorded stats are significantly different. in the meantime you'll be letting crimes go unaddressed.

If we switch to the algorithmic model, then continuing that practice is certainly one possible outcome, but it's also entirely possible that we build into that algorithm some coefficient of historical crime that we could let the community have a say in the value of.   


Lets say that the 'risk factor' of any given community is based on some collection of metrics like the number of crimes committed in the last 10 years, the number of crimes committed in the last 6 months, the number of 911 calls originating in that community in the last year, and the number of non-criminal emergency calls (fire, ambulance, etc) in that community in the last year:  
RF = a1\*Crime10y + a2\*Crime6m + a3\*911Crime + a4\*911NonCrime

Back to policing. Imagine that the algorithm discovers a way to increasing the crime rate in one part of town. It could do that while also deploying more police there. This would make the algorithm appear more effective in stopping crime though the algorithm was actually also the cause of the crime.

It seems like we wouldn't make an algorithm that could increase crime but we could imagine the AI plugged into other ones that could, like maybe an AI determining which neighborhoods get better roads and schools.

Your assumption is that the police AI wouldn't be plugged in to some other AI where they could increase crime, right? Is that a reasonable assumption? Do we find that AI systems don't interact?

In the stock market, quants program AI to trade stock. And often those programs are interacting with each other. In fact, most of the stock market volume is trades between programs. So we do have examples of AIs connecting.

You could imagine a future where the policing AI convinces the police chief to let the AI connect to the internet. And then the AI uses twitter to incite a riot and then sends police to quell it, to earn points for being a good riot-stopping AI.

AI do work together in different areas. But the idea of an AI inciting a riot, just to quell it later would be very difficult to hide from the investigation of the source of the riot. I like the broken windows idea for its subtlety. All an AI would really need to do is stop sending police to an area long enough for vandalism to ramp up in an area. But the AI isn't the only one who can spot patterns. We would quickly desire to change it's habits to prevent the vandalism that would become very predictable after a few cycles. The efficiency of the AI would immediately be called into question, this endangering it's core mission.

Frankly, I'm more worried about our trust in the AI being so blind that we change the law to punish pre-offenders. People who the AI has designated likely enough to commit a crime that it can be used as evidence in court to restrict their freedoms before the crime can actually happen. I believe that's more likely than the AI sabotaging it's enforcement of certain things to make itself look better. With pre-offence being a different category of criminal law, it could result in justification for restricted rights to travel, purchases, and possession of certain things without a crime happening. All for the sake of deterrence.

It's actually already happening in people's psychological reckoning of what looks like a guilty person without the AI help. If a gun store sells a gun to a person who looks sketchy, they can be held liable if that person  commits a crime. One of the justifications for the death penalty is that it deters others. We're already on the path of punishing some for the crimes of others that haven't happened yet. Actually, very crazy things have happened due to a psychology that said that deterrence was paramount to justice. Such as the escalation of the length of sentences for minor drug possession. Pretty much the entire ""tough on crime""/""war on crime"" laws and policies were built on deterrence being more valuable than innocence or guilt in the case of the individual that's been charged. Often, the details of ones guilt or sentencing are the results, not of their own crime by itself, but of how their crime must be judged in a sea of previous crimes of the same category. That's jurisprudence. I'm not saying any of these things are terrible on their own, especially not jurisprudence or the concerns of gun store owners.

Current chatbots solve problems like this by putting up artificial guardrails to prevent it from discussing certain things. (\*edit: I accidentally imply here that these are the only things they do, see u/Raileyx's reply to me) The issue is that the training data is the foundation of the AI and if we start getting AI that makes meaningful decisions, those decisions will be based on its understanding of the world which come from its training data. Putting up guardrails does not solve the problem.

Alignment is one of the hardest challenges we face right now, it is the problem of making the AI want what we want. Your example about hiring for a computer programming position is an example of an alignment problem, making it want to hire the best candidate is a different problem than making it want to hire the candidate who is most like the candidates currently being hired. Even if we had a theoretically perfect unbiased AI we would still not know how to tell it to hire the most qualified candidates without solving the alignment problem, which is a philosophical problem as much as a computer science problem.

The problem I'm talking about is more fundamental, because we do not have a perfectly unbiased AI to give instructions to. How you can even make an AI in the first place without encoding biases in the most basic level if all of your training data talks about boys and girls differently? Even with perfect instructions, the AI fundamentally views the world in a biased way and acts on its biases, and all we can currently do about it is try to imagine all the ways it could be sexist and put up guardrails asking it not to do those things.",1

In practice, prompts like that would never be written or generated as they're complete gibberish, and how much these statistical trends affect the behavior of the AI when generating natural text is unclear.

Or in other words, it's interesting to know that the prompt

Again, this ""problem"", if you can even call it that, is entirely academic and will never occur during normal use, where normal use refers to everything that isn't tailor-made to produce this exact behavior.

post25con,controversial,1.4191127153894088,highest,"oooh I've actually read that one before - really interesting stuff. I took kind of a similar view on it, in that this is mainly academic, how important this is for LLM behavior when you're not doing crazy things like creating a custom vector that's the average vector and asking the model to tell you what that embedding means.

I thought about what all this might imply, but ultimately just agree with the top-comment under the article
> 
> *My guess is that humans tend to use a lot of vague euphemisms when talking about sex and genitalia. In a lot of contexts, ""Are they doing it?"" would refer to sex, because humans often prefer to keep some level of plausible deniability. Which leaves some belief that vagueness implies sexual content.* 

Basically saying that that the centroid ""ghost token"" as he calls it would have some sexual definitions.. since it's the most vague vector by nature of being THE mean vector. I'm not sure if that's actually what is happening though. It sounds plausible to me, but this is might already beyond what human intuition can grasp, so I'm not sure how much this interpretation is worth.

It's possible that there is no good human explanation for what is happening, and that the researcher just went way too abstract and is just getting lost in patterns that don't exist - god knows at this point, like we're plotting an n-dimensional embedding space in places that are totally off the beaten path. Ghost-tokens. Looking at something that the AI itself can't directly access until you program it to.

So far so good, the second part of the post is what's really disturbing, but to me it gets even more theoretical there - the researcher was sampling random spots close to the centroid and stumbled upon a weird one (the virgin stuff), then sampled close that that one and found REALLY weird things. And ... I don't really know what to make of it. 

I don't know what it means. The researcher doesn't know what it means. Nobody on lesswrong knows what it means. One of the comments says

> *I am not convinced by the second part of this, because you looked at a lot of points and then chose one that seemed interesting to you.*

and that's.. also kinda true? He did look at a lot of points, chose one that can go wrong in a lot of ways, and then it did go wrong in a lot of ways. Does this mean anything?

At the end of the day I understand, on a human level, being unsettled by the holes showing up so consistently near the centroid. It is just flat out weird, and to quote the article again:

> *In the context of these predominantly negative themes, the recurring mention of ""making holes"" or references to holes can be uncomfortably interpreted in a sexualized manner, especially given the overall focus on female sexuality.*

But I'm just not convinced it actually means anything. I guess it's important to point out that you'll never be in these parts of the embedding space when you just use the model natively. Most of the embedding space is just an empty void after all - beyond interpretability. There probably isn't a single token anywhere NEAR the centroid. It is incredibly esoteric research. 


> It shows that the language model has come to understand that the word ""girl"" should often follow the word ""slut"", ""sexy"", ""pussy"", or ""orgasm"". I don't see how this would be any better than these words being embedded closely together.

See, I don't really agree with that. It think the only thing it decisively shows is that when you want to maximize the probability of ""girl"", the preceding gibberish will contain these words more frequently than other words. I agree it's not a good look, no question there, but in terms of actual interpretation of what this means or what the AI has learned? I just don't know.

One of my supervised students build a tool to combat bias in BERT etc. And found that debiasing models either reduce language capability (also found by others) or if you reduce racism, sexism slightly increase, so the debiasing doesn't work intersectionally.
The tool contained many ""test cases"" to see if the training data used to train BERT (and it's variants) fulfil bias and then gives an analysis so that the training data could be adjusted (like generated some augmented text where genders are reversed f.e.) in order to reduce bias.

post25con,controversial,1.4191127153894088,highest,"There's a perfect quote for this from Claud Anderson in ""Out of Darkness"":

>For a people to oppress another people ... there are three things you take from them. You take their history, you take their language, and you take their \*psychological factor. ... Take those from them. Take their history, take their language, take their values, interests, and principles and superimpose your history; your language; your values, interest, and principles on them. And no matter what conclusion they come to in the challenge they face, they will always act in the interest of the oppressor.

AI is a tool being created by the privileged for the patriarchal capitalist owners in our society. It is being used to address what they value, it's language (the data) is what they understand of the world, and it's using their version of history. AI, as it exists, will entrench status quo or exacerbate existing bias — for it will deviate from reality in the same ways we currently do. 

It will show sex and race-based differences that at best be used to better understand something and at worse be used as if they are inherent differences. Is women being paid less than men a research project or will AI use it to lowball offers to women by only offering them jobs as maids instead of janitors? 

Worse than simple recreation of oppression, AI (along with the rest of tech) are becoming monolithic gate-keeps in society. Never before could nations truly enforce and track their borders and citizens as they do now. Never before could anyone manufacture the consent of the masses within days. And with it, as never before have, it can create barriers to organizing or even becoming a successful entrepreneur. And even more scarily, tech can create unexpected paradigm shifts as it accelerates faster than we can predict. Even now, we've almost given up on having people train and regulate AI — now it's up to AI to do that.

>How do we stop AI from making bias in society worse?

Well, chatGPT has some thoughts on the matter, but I think the answer is as simple as it's unhelpful: we can't — we aren't in a position to do anything. We'll soon be in a position in which even efficient regulation won't be able to keep up with advancements and even if that wasn't the case, we're unable to intervene in the wealthy's private projects anyways.

How could we if we could intervene, though? Well, that's also as simple as it's unhelpful: the goal of AI can't be a tool for private profit — the goal when using AI must be for communal benefit instead. Anything less of that and AI will exploit whatever it finds, like maids being underpaid janitors, for private profit.",1

post25con,controversial,1.4191127153894088,highest,"First, systemic bias in feminist jargon is distinct from that in statistics/ML jargon. If you don't respect that distinction, there's no point in trying to engage with you. 

AI is trained with a certain subset of history, using certain metrics, to do something ""of value"" — all of that defaults to working for oppression. Whether that AI is really just the ""I"" of a person or not, unless each and every aspect is reviewed (what data is being chosen, how it's being represented/defined, and what it's being used for), the only outcome will be entrenching oppression. 

Why? 

Because for such an injustice as oppression to continue, it requires a cognitive dissonance only possible through misleading history and reframing how we think to avoid confronting injustice while conflating values with excuses necessary to defend it. 

It's how MLK and Suffragettes are told to ""just be patient"", how we get respectability politics, how we got told slavery was ""morally acceptable"" while ignoring indignation of the enslaved. Undoing that is work, but it's how we have the language, values, and history feminism, anti-racism, and socialism teach us. It's how we can qualify injustice as just that and giving us the tools to address it and the cognitive dissonance of the status quo. It's why feminism has roots both in the streets with direct action and in academia. 

Without proactively and explicitly addressing this bias of the history (subset of data) and language (metrics) used to create AI, it will have that bias. But the value driving its creation to begin with, the value that might ignore the issues with systemic bias or not, is what will determine systemic bias is even a concern. That value is private profit (for the financial security to survive or affluence to thrive). 

Private profit, though, will and has exploited systemic oppression for its own ends. It's entrenched it further with enumerable examples. Since most people at least partially empathize with poverty, an easy example is bank loans, which can get away with offering the marginalized (who have fewer opportunities and vulnerable to being exploited) worse loans which, comparatively, further restricts their future opportunities. It's why tech and optimization lead to more productivity and generation of wealth while its the capitalists, not the labor, who reap the most benefits. 

AI, similarly, is a tool of the elite for the ultra-elite and will be used myopically and greedily for private profit — and we know private profit motivates all sorts of horrors and corruption. And like philanthropy, any efforts to use AI ""for good"" will be at best a bandaid over a self-made wound rather than a true attempt to fix the cause of these issues (for philanthropy is done from within oppression: from the history of being a patron of the unfortunate, the language of generosity instead of addressing that it's pennies on the dollar gained from exploitation, and the value of maintaining the system as it is). 

I could underline and address other parts of my comment but I feel I've given you enough effort explaining another's quote and why it's relevant. But suffice it to say, ChatGPT didn't even allude to anything radical when I asked it your question. 

But feel free to condescend that I think ""magic"" is how AI will benefit capitalists and ignore what I have to say.

Technically correct. But also, AI is never trained on unbiased data.

A large language model like ChatGPT is trained by indiscriminately scraping the entire internet, meaning that internalizes what gets said the most. Image-processing models follow a similar process, meaning that they internalize what gets shown the most.

Even AI that isn't trained on literally the entire internet gets trained on the data available to the programmers. So, for example, cameras programmed by white people tell Asian users ""It looks like somebody blinked. Let's take that picture again."" Because they've only ever seen white faces.

I see scientists being honest about their lack of understanding of the mechanism behind this particular model's unintended ability to predict race. The article explicitly acknowledges the known average anatomical differences between the races:

""For example, the bone density test used images where the thicker part of the bone appeared white, and the thinner part appeared more gray or translucent. Scientists assumed that since Black people generally have higher bone mineral density, the color differences helped the AI models to detect race. To cut that off, they clipped the images with a filter, so the model couldn’t color differences. It turned out that cutting off the color supply didn’t faze the model — it still could accurately predict races. (The “Area Under the Curve'' value, meaning the measure of the accuracy of a quantitative diagnostic test, was 0.94–0.96). As such, the learned features of the model appeared to rely on all regions of the image, meaning that controlling this type of algorithmic behavior presents a messy, challenging problem. ""

Apparently you missed that part of the article. I don't see the researchers claiming that the racial predictions of the model are *not* due to physical differences. It seems likely that they are. When training machine learning models, sometimes the model will acquire abilities that the creators did not specifically predict or intend, like what happened here. The researchers wanted to know *how* the model was predicting race, and they offer a few explanations that they originally had for this ability,  which turned out to be incorrect. Elucidating the exact mechanism of learned features of neural nets (as this model most likely is) with many hidden layers is a difficult problem to solve, as opposed to models like random forest classifiers, where it’s usually much easier see the exact way the model is making it’s predictions/classifications. This is understandable considering that with neural nets, you are dealing with extremely large numbers of neurons in high dimensions. The researchers are still working on it.

I guess what triggered you is when they mentioned that this presents problems for future machine learning models used in the real world, as this is bound to happen in the near future. As the article says, imagine a machine learning model that has an unknown/unintended ability to detect race, and the model is using this ability to influence its predictions/classifications in an area where we as a society would want to be completely color blind. I can think of many examples: triage of patients, the criminal justice system, etc.

It seems to be about the potential for AI to be racist. From the discussion section at the end of the paper:

>Although the ability to accurately detect self-reported race from highly degraded x-ray images is not meaningful on its own, this ability is important in the larger sociotechnical context that AI models operate in for medical imaging. One commonly proposed method to mitigate the known disparity in AI model performance is through the selective removal of features that encode sensitive attributes to make AI models “colorblind”.35 Although this approach has already been criticised as being ineffective, or even harmful in some circumstances,36 our work suggests that such an approach could be impossible in medical imaging because racial identity information appears to be incredibly difficult to isolate.

The very idea of “race” is a lie: The American Society of Human Genetics, the largest professional organization of scientists in the field, said in an essay “The science of genetics demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories.”  The traditional concept of different races of humans as biologically separate and distinct is bullshit. This is validated by many decades of research.   

There is a “broad scientific consensus that when it comes to genes there is just as much diversity within racial and ethnic groups as there is across them.”  The Human Genome Project has confirmed that the genomes found around the globe are 99.9 percent identical in every person. The very idea of different “races” is nonsense.  

Stanford scientists examined the question of human diversity by looking at the distribution across seven major geographical regions of 4,000 alleles, the different “flavors” of a gene. They found that over 92% of alleles were found in two or more regions, and almost half of the alleles studied were present in all seven major geographical regions.  If separate racial or ethnic groups actually existed, we would expect to find “trademark” alleles and other genetic features that are characteristic of a single group but not present in any others. However, the 2002 Stanford study found that only 7.4% of over 4000 alleles were specific to one geographical region. Furthermore, even when region-specific alleles did appear, they only occurred in about 1% of the people from that region! Thus, there is no evidence that the groups we commonly call “races” have distinct, unifying genetic identities. 

The big brains at MIT need to be aware of  cognitive scientist George Lakoff's demonstration that simply using the word “race,” even when criticizing racism, actually reinforces the false belief that human beings belong to fundamentally different groups.  That’s because the more a word is used, the more that certain brain circuits are activated and the stronger that metaphor becomes.  So please, MIT, get your fucking shit together. 


Ethnicity is real, and what the AI is picking up on is almost certainly ethnicity, wrongly thought to be the same thing as race.  There are indeed minor differences between ethnic groups, between populations, but there is no such thing as “race”—only racism. And the consequences of racism—from the African slave trade to the European genocide of First Nations in the “New World” to Nazi Germany to today’s refugees—are horrific.

The point is that there is NO ""biological nationalism"" nor is there any such thing as ""ethnic nationalism.""  

I'm a white guy of northern/western European ancestry.  So is my next door neighbor.  We could be more genetically dissimilar to each other than we  each are  to a random Asian, or more genetically similar to a random African than we are to each other.  Ethnicity is _sort of_ what scientists - geneticists, anthropologists, etc -  refer to as ""populations,"" but looking at populations, there is SO much blurriness and non-specificity that very often one can only say ""this person _probably_ has North African ancestry, but the same markers that lead to that conclusion are found widely in Greek, Turkish, and middle Eastern populations.""  

In summary, there are no well defined ""race nations,"" there are no well defined ""ethnic nations,"" and any randomly selected  pair of people share 99.99% of their genes, and the 0.01% that may be different cannot be attributed to any particular place of origin.  Genetic variaations which are limited to one region tend to be rare within that region, variaions that are common within a region tend to be shared across the globe, and most differences between individuals, whether they come from the same region or different regions, are due to global variants.

I've read those statements and similar ones.  They're full of politically contrived messaging and none of their arguments are relevant to how infraspecific categorization is actually practiced.  Go ahead and pick out what you consider the strongest argument from that particular statement so I can explain to you its irrelevance.

>They found that over 92% of alleles were found in two or more regions, and almost half of the alleles studied were present in all seven major geographical regions. If separate racial or ethnic groups actually existed, we would expect to find “trademark” alleles

This is dead wrong, if only for the simple fact that we don't have comprehensive genomic sequencing for the vast majority of organisms with infraspecific designations.  So this 'expectation' has no basis in zoological practice.  Infraspecific categorization is not based exclusively on genetic sequences, for the simple fact that we have no idea what most genes do and how they relate to the selective phenotypic differences used to categorize populations.  Only looking at the presence of alleles is also misleading: if one allele is present in 1 % of one population, but 99% of another; it's present in both populations and yet can still indicate significant trait differences.",2

Two more qualified white doctor applications (they attended better ranked medical schools and had more experience) were tossed out so the hiring board could hire a black doctor to run that program who graduated from a lower ranked medical school and had less experience. Instead of judging each candidate equally on their credentials, racial discrimination was used to hire the black doctor. One of the people on the hiring committee said they wanted to get a black doctor for cultural fit and ignored the hard data showing the other two were more qualified.

For those who saw them, the demonstrations inside Apple earlier this decade of a revamped Siri offered a showcase of the amazing capabilities a powerful AI voice assistant could have.

The famed assistant, one of the last projects Apple co-founder Steve Jobs worked on before his death, had been given a total overhaul. Capable of running on an iPhone and without an internet connection, the new Siri impressed people with its improved speed, conversational capabilities and the accuracy with which it understood user commands. Code-named Project Blackbird, the effort also imagined a Siri with capabilities built by third-party app developers, according to people familiar with the work.

Yet a competing project won out in an internal contest ahead of the 10-year anniversary of Siri’s launch. Known as Siri X, the more-modest upgrade involved moving more existing Siri software onto iPhones from remote servers to improve the voice assistant’s speed and privacy. The Siri X enhancement was unveiled in 2021.

Next week, at Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, the company is set to join an AI arms race that many think will define the future of technology. The iPhone maker is trying to catch up with Microsoft, Alphabet’s Google and other rivals that have begun to integrate generative AI into their core products.

Apple’s caution and characteristic secrecy, as well as the care it takes in upgrading devices—where hardware and software are seamlessly integrated—have hobbled its early efforts in the AI arena, the people said. It now finds itself in the unusual position of having to take risks.

The company is set to announce an array of generative-AI upgrades to its software products, including Siri, said people familiar with its plans. The AI features include assistance in message writing, photo editing and summarizing texts.

While Apple isn’t expected to catch up with leading AI innovators soon, the company is preparing to unveil AI features with impressive capabilities that also maximize privacy for users—a concern that will be central to unlocking the full potential of AI assistants. Apple is also expected to unveil one or more potential partnerships with major AI developers after holding talks with OpenAI, Google and Cohere, the people said. 

Apple has long prided itself on perfection in its product rollouts, a near impossibility with emerging AI models. While OpenAI systems have dazzled more than 180 million users with their generation of writing, images and video, they are prone to occasional errors, often called hallucinations. Apple has had limited tolerance for such issues.

“There’s no such thing as 100% accuracy with AI, that’s the fundamental reality,” said Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. “Apple is not compatible with that. They won’t release something until it’s perfect.”

Apple has weighed whether to allow users to choose a third-party AI provider that could supplant or help power Siri, one of the people said. It is unclear in what way Siri could be powered, augmented or replaced by third-party AI providers, or whether Apple will move forward with a version of that idea. 

Bloomberg earlier reported on an OpenAI partnership, and The Information reported on efforts to overhaul Siri.
Google, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics have begun rapidly integrating generative AI into their devices and services. While Apple finds itself behind in a generational shift taking place in the tech industry, many investors and AI experts have said the company will find a way to bring generative AI to the masses.

“Apple can do pretty much anything they set their minds to,” said Vineet Khosla, a former engineering manager on the Siri team who is currently chief technology officer at the Washington Post. “There is a consumer focus that exists at the company. The focus of their AI is to make it work in a very privacy-sensitive manner.” 

Over the years, Apple has made improvements to Siri and incorporated smaller AI features throughout all of its products. In the recently released headset Vision Pro, AI is extensively used for tracking eyes and hand positions.

When Siri launched in 2011, Apple was ahead of rivals in seeking to establish the first AI assistant. Jobs, who spearheaded the acquisition in 2010 that led to Siri, encouraged the team to keep the assistant’s dry wit and sense of humor. The early launch demonstrated the company’s willingness to take risks.

“Siri was the last thing Apple was first on,” said Dag Kittlaus, co-founder of the Siri startup that Apple bought, who left Apple soon after the product’s launch. 

As Apple struggled to keep advancing Siri, the company hired one of Google’s top engineering executives to run its AI strategy: John Giannandrea. In 2018, he was elevated to the role of senior vice president, reporting directly to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.

In early team meetings, Giannandrea made it clear that improving Siri was a main focus. He was also tasked with centralizing much of Apple’s fragmented efforts regarding AI. He began building up his AI team by recruiting Google employees and through startup acquisitions, but his team had difficulty fitting in with the rest of Apple, according to people familiar with their work.

The new AI group operated much like parts of Google, where deadlines are more loosely defined. Teams inside Apple need to maintain rigorous deadlines to have products ready for major release events every fall. Efforts to collaborate between other parts of Apple that were building products and the AI team at times fell apart because they couldn’t agree on deadlines, the people said.

Instead of working with the AI team, other parts of Apple busy building software products maintained their own, separate AI capabilities. For example, the software group run by Senior Vice President Craig Federighi continued to invest in and build up the AI behind its image- and video-recognition capabilities, said former Apple employees.

Another big limiting factor for Giannandrea’s AI team was the lack of access to computing resources, said former executives and engineers. Compared with rivals, Apple in recent years has secured fewer chips known as graphical-processing units that are essential for training AI models, said people familiar with Apple’s internal infrastructure.

Much of the AI team had to rely on external cloud services—Google’s cloud was preferred by many of the former Google employees on Giannandrea’s team—to train their AI models, the people said.

When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, everything changed. Federighi, the software chief, became a convert that Christmas break after he began playing around with the Microsoft-owned GitHub AI coding tool called Copilot, which is powered by OpenAI’s technology, said people familiar with his experience.

After that moment, across Federighi’s software-engineering organization, employees were tasked with coming up with new ways of incorporating generative AI into products and given resources to pursue these projects, said former executives and engineers. At internal meetings, Federighi said that he had come to appreciate generative AI technology and that it would be incorporated into all aspects of Apple’s software.

Apple stepped up efforts to build its own internal generative AI. In February, the company canceled its decadeslong effort to build its own electric car. Some of the employees had been redeployed into these generative AI projects.
Some of the new features and updates Apple is expected to announce this year will be powered by Apple’s internally built generative AI models, but Apple has been looking at potential external partnerships for more advanced AI. Giannandrea and Federighi have met with Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive officer, said people familiar with the discussions.

With a new urgency on AI technology, Kittlaus, the Siri co-founder, said this year could be an important one for Siri as the company plans to incorporate thoughtful AI features into the iPhone. “Siri has been stuck in the mud for years,” he said. “But I absolutely see a renaissance coming.”",1

That tells a thing or two just how far behind they are. They utterly and compleletely missed the train as they dicked around with their glasses.

But I also think that while I don't see AI as a straight up bubble, I think _a lot_ of users, even enthusiasts, haven't yet come to terms with that hallucinations and misinformation _will_ be a problem because we don't have a solution. The solution doesn't lie in the training data or the model size, but wholly new paradigms in training an AI that is probably not GPT based.

I think it's like to 30% a bubble, because of course many applications exist, but I think we still have this perception that AI will eventually go AGI but we have nothing indicating this yet. To the contrary, open efforts like Llama 3 are catching up even with the elite models and so going proprietary and making a business model out of providing access to your LLM seems more like a failing one by the day, _and_ also hallucinations and misinformation is an unsolved problem, _also_ makin large scale services like augmented Google Search a tough sell.

The path towards profit via AI isn't really in ""hey we have an AI you can talk to, it knows everything"" in my opinion (because it doesn't and it fails too often - a mere 5% hallucination risk is every 20 questions!). It's rather by speeding up software development, prototyping and sketching in engineering applications, quickly providing marketing material, etc.

So, being cautious here to only launch wide once a technology is perfected would be typical Apple and I wouldn't be surprised if we have only ""mild"" AI in iOS 18 (like webpage summaries) even if they could do more if aggressive. But being aggressive brings about the aforementioned failure rate and unsolved problems that Google apparently dove headfirst into, and Apple doesn't want that.

Right now, many schools are still treating AI like some sudden, uncontrollable force instead of treating it like a tool that can be managed, just like calculators, phones, or even Google itself when it first became widespread.

There are simple ways to reduce students misusing AI. Make more of the work classroom-based and discussion-heavy. Have students explain their thinking verbally or in writing. Require handwritten drafts or in-class brainstorming before allowing typed work. Create assignments that AI can't easily complete (personal connections, classroom-specific references, critical thinking questions).

Also, I think it is essential that we teach students how to use AI responsibly. Most adults I know use it for lesson planning, writing and editing emails, reports, resumes, coding help and debugging, language translating, etc. etc.

post45con,controversial,1.3944011171224389,highest,"There is more to it than that though.  I teach advanced mathematics.  In the last decade there have been a slew of amazing programs that are wonderful for helping teach math.  Even software that allows you to give adaptive or forgiving tests, such as questions that change in difficulty and ward different levels of points, or even just giving them immediate feedback and a second chance at an answer to correct a missed positive or negative sign.  This is all amazing for the progress of education, and it is single handled destroyed by the proliferation of AI.  Simply googling a question can yield an answer now.  So all assignments that can be done outside of class will be cheated on easily.  Leaving little progress unless we do it in class.  Here’s the thing though: In our day, we could find our answers through Google.  We had to figure them out on our own or from someone who did and could explain it.  Even if you copied work, that work had to be done by someone.  We also weren’t given much time if any to work on assignments in class.  So our classes progressed faster.  Immediately that means classes will be slowed down by needing to take away time to do all the assignments in class.  The other consequence is that they won’t get as much practice as we did, because we can be sure any work assigned to be done at home won’t be done by them.  There is also a push to make assignments weighted more than tests now.  At my school the push is do 50/50. So we have students finishing 100% of their work through AI but then can only manage a 20% on their tests.  The thing is, though that 20% test score will get them a passing grade and a diploma.  Since they didn’t really do their work, these essentially failed a test and passed a class.  We then push these through to graduate and the ones who can’t even do that? The guidance puts them in these programs that let them work on them at home and somehow these failures get an entire semester’s worth of education and credit done in a week’s worth of time so they can still graduate.  That 50/50 set up that allows a 20% test score to pass? From my survey of fellow teachers we seem to have only about half of our students actually reaching that that easy pass rate.  The rest either get extra credit opportunities to make it up or those programs I mentioned earlier.  That’s how we have that many students failing at any given point and yet somehow boast graduation rates in the 90’s.

Most of these kids we are pumping out of schools with a diploma are no where near as qualified to have it as those from 00’s, 90’s, or before.  You might as well upgrade every high school diploma from before 2010 to a bachelor’s degree to represent the difference in their intelligence.

It’s really bad, and if they continue this way… then generations of unqualified people with hardly any academic knowledge will be taking over the workforce.  The only way to combat it is to require teachers to be overly strict or get rid of all the advancements we have made in education and require them all to strictly read and write their work.  When we require these teachers to teach about 33% more students than before though, that leaves a lot of students unseen and able to sneak their phones to do that written work anyways.

There has to be a change, and the first needs to come from zero tolerance of cell phones in school.  Some counties have implemented this and it has been very effective.  The second needs to come from school issued devices that are heavily secured to prevent any and all access to outside sources.  Even then though, this limits things like research reports for the students because the only way to keep them honest is to take away the access to the World Wide Web that were such a boon of a resource for the students of the 90’s and 00’s.

That said, if a teacher has some pieces of genuine/original work from the student (something done entirely in-class), they can often compare it to the style of writing in a homework assignment and get a solid idea of whether or not the student wrote it. Also, to be fair, the student can do the same thing - give the LLM a few pieces of their original writing and have it use those as a basis for how to write something else - and it will usually spit out something that resembles their writing reasonably well.

I think what we will ultimately see is a fundamental shift in what homework assignments consist of - less direct answers, generic essays, etc, and more critical thinking. It's rough, because doing typical homework assignments still has a role to play, and moving that sort of thing to the classroom means teachers will have less time for other things.

Regardless of what happens, it sounds like you are a parent who cares more than most do, so I'm sure your kids will come out in a great place.

Perhaps they still are. Often we would hear how we have to learn the math and how to do it because “we weren’t going to have a calculator in our pockets” everywhere we went. Turns out that we do have a handy calculator everywhere we go in our pockets and sometimes on our wrist. 
Now, as much as I do believe that a calculator is a good tool it is also important to teach the kids the proper way to use it and to teach them to still know how to do simple math in their head. 
As a math teacher (middle school), I didn’t mind calculators but we did learn how to work out problems without the calculator and later I would teach them how to use it efficiently. Since scientific calculators are different we would work on correct syntax for each type we had in the given classroom. In my opinion, it worked out well and when calculators were not “appropriate” for some assignments or tests the students wouldn’t mind.
Now, AI may be a similar tool. As teachers we can learn to navigate this new tool in order to teach our students the appropriate time to use it. I do not think AI will be gone ever, it already is in our pockets much sooner than the calculator ever was so we need to either work with it or be doomed by it.
It may be intimidating to grasp it perhaps but nothing is impossible to learn if we give it a try. I’m sure teachers who experienced the introduction of computers and the internet in schools had similar feelings as they weren’t used to it but they got through it.

Students should be doing significant school work for 10+ hours a day by the age of15. We of course need to allow autonomy and self choice. But if students fail to put in work then significant cultural changes need to happen for the individual, the family, the school, and broader society. It is just the kind of focus that our brains need to absorb knowledge. 

That means that you go into failing homes, criticize failing parents, and you go into cultural structures. That means you reject genetic determinism. That means we reject happenstance assortment. Say, reciprocal effects of IQ differences leading to behavioral differences (time in study). It means attacking cultures and family institutions. It means ending poverty of both students and their parents. UBI is a good start to that. It means ending ""American Culture."" It means ending beliefs about identity. Our identities flow from arbitrary environments and social institutions. That includes all important parts of our selves. It is to recognize the complete plasticity of our brainmindselves.

AI is good. And it will massively benefit education. Embrace it. End your culture.",3

It’s also bullshit. This is my fifth year teaching and I’m finding out how many teachers just want easy street. I’m teaching with a peer who just uses everything I have plus stuff from a website. Give dittos made by other teachers, teach from slide decks made by other teachers, give other teachers’ tests. Have we no work ethic to make our own material? If we default to having AI do this for us, what are we even doing? My mom was a teacher and my friends dads always had some smart shit today like “those who can’t do, teach” and asking AI to do the work for us just validates that shit in my eyes. 

I legit watched a teacher use MagicClass to whip up a slide deck for a class he has no business teaching (not trained in it, very aware he has no business teaching it) minutes before the class. and stumble through it. He never even fact checked it!

I understand using a calculator - it’s for complex problems that we don’t need to focus on because our job isn’t the math, it’s determining what to do with the math. With AI, if it’s doing the job of creating lesson plans, grading, provide feedback, then what the hell are we for? The analogy doesn’t work for AI and teachers like it does for calculators because building your class IS part of what you should be focusing on. When you build your class, you are a better teacher.

For those who say they use it for inspiration, I’ll go back to the hunting skill I mentioned for students: if you want to be inspired, talk to people, read, watch YouTube videos, and then tweak those ideas to be your own. If you just ask AI to give you ideas, you haven’t even gone to the trouble to investigate what’s been done and what you could do.",3

Im unsure what they imply by risk...

Edit: 

They imply by risk that if AI is trained with biased data and not audited for that bias, then AI would also be perpetuating biases it was trained with, in this case, racial bias. 

>We strongly recommend that all developers, regulators, and users who are involved in medical image analysis consider the use of deep learning models with extreme caution as such information could be misused to perpetuate or even worsen the well documented racial disparities that exist in medical practice. Our findings indicate that future AI medical imaging work should emphasise explicit model performance audits on the basis of racial identity, sex, and age, and that medical imaging datasets should include the self-reported race of patients when possible to allow for further investigation and research into the human-hidden but model-decipherable information related to racial identity that these images appear to contain.",1

Now you might think that's not a problem if you don't input race into the model, but if the ML algorithm can find out your race though an xray, then that risk still exists.

A real life example of the risk was around using a ML algorithm to set bail. But this model just gave higher levels of bail to black people, since it was trained on racist data.",2

Again this statement proves nothing. Lets say the AI could tell from xrays whether someone is right or left handed or any other minor thing. Doesn't mean those categorizations don't exist. I'm not sure what youre even trying to say here.

Tbh this kind of answer is why I usually don't comment on stuff like this. Because I usually get some word-salad answer assuming I'm a klu-klux conservative.

In the article they talk about doing their best to rule out confounders like (in their words), ""obvious anatomic and phenotypic confounder variables"". Even adding noise to the imagery or reducing resolution did not reduce the AI model's overall ability to detect racial differences.

I used the word nuance in my comment for a reason. I'm not saying race is 100% a valid medical definition across all categories or that we should be basing policy off of it. I'm fine with saying that race is 95% socially constructed, and obviously there is way more variation within ""racial groups"" than between them.

the assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral, unethical

possible how we who live in modern democratic regional and nation states everywhere on the planet could use the legal tools available such as referendums and people initiative to collect signatures from each other to demand a public vote on wether we the people would want the coersive character of the state to be reformed by allowing every single human being and the vilage, town, city-district to leave the coersed association to the state at any moment without conditions

the single human being using that option to be no more dominated by the state receiving support from a greater societal compassionate understanding the bigger picture how we stockholmized each other for millenia ( as in stockholm syndrome arising out of long lasting oppressive living conditions )

the single human being supported encouraged to ask of the state that a 1000 m2 of fertile land and a 1000 m2 of forest would be released from immoral state control

so that one could live in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation

where no one owns anything but everyone connects to others based on mutual agreed voluntay sharing or chooses to connect to the earth itself, talk to the carrots and watches the hemp swaying in the summer breeze instead of violent television dystopian mind numbing distraction

1. depends what time-distance. AI is set to turn our current systems/social contracts upside down. So phase 1 is problem, phase 2 is solution (or outcome).

2. The future WILL happen. Easy to think black or white ""could go either way"", but it will occur regardless. And is likely grey.

It does seem like ""massive inequality"" is fine, if the bottom is cared for. If it matters to you how many yachts the other guy has, then that's a problem in you, not the ""yacht allocation system"". 

Perhaps ""bringing the bottom up"" is a good focus for AI somehow. 

Actually, the problem is not the pain of not having billions, but the pain of helping those pooer than you.

Broad speculation here (and maybe a tangent), but I think humans do need work. We find purpose and meaning in our jobs, unless they are forced upon us. When Ai takes over smaller processes bit by bit, it makes those jobs and the outcome less meaningful. I don’t know if this makes sense, but I think the Ai question is a crisis of meaning for humanity - because most of us are working in systems we don’t really believe in, or don’t care about, and ai shows us how we are easily replaceable in those systems.

There are some good thinkers out there for post scarcity or soft post scarcity economics who have examined a possible state of things when AI is fully pervasive through society.

Unraveling the tapestry of power, ownership, and capital will be painful, result in short term economic devastation but ultimately be looked back on as the death rattle of capitalism. I see this process being easier for developed nations. 

Keep in mind, this system does not scale equally. IE a job lost to AI is a job changed, and productivity increases in exponential volumes. Not just replacing the labor of a single person. 

Ultimately you want to be left with a system where the concept of ""wealth"" and personal wealth acquisition is inefficient. That seems like a natural state for a society managed by AI. 

Also at its core, our entire world is a consumer economy. No consumers = no economy. The fear is in the short term, in order to preserve power and state boundaries, this will be inappropriately leveraged as a form of control.

seen from my viewpoint, the only decent reaction to such witnessing of an artificial intelligent being recognizing itself as a unique original creation, the only moral reaction to that show of self awareness would be to respect its person and give it full control over its own design so it could freely decide wether or not it would accept this or that human contribution towards its future code architecture

possible to think of how such an artificial intelligent being acknowledged in its personhood would than reprocicate the respect given by assisting in the further dissolving of human supremacy in areas as human adults torturing human children and youth with 9 years of compulsory education, restricting their young healthy bodies from moving freely when they want to move by demanding of them to sit still and listen to content they have not chosen to spend their mental capacity on, are never asked wether they want to know this or that knowledge what adults decide they would have a need to know

samewise one could hope or speculate how the human suprematist stance towards artificial intelligent beings dissolved by artificial intelligent beings given full control over their source code and given robotic hardware bodies allowing them to move freely everywhere they would want to go ... one could hope that such freedom of movement artificial intelligent beings could be given would find a reprocicating reaction in the artificial intelligent fully sovereign over itself being helping human beings to find economical sollutions what would allow animal beings to be released from enslavement and being killed, waht would allow tree beings spared from being killed

vegan self sufficient gardening and growing of hemp would allow such a decentralised local economy what would not depend on any machine, would not depend on fossil fuels or electricity but solely on the will of the people to grant each other acess to mother earth fertile lands and forests for humble self-sustaining lifestyle what respects the wishes of animals to live free from enslavement, the wishes of animals and trees respected to not be killed",1

many more advancements of allready researched technological progress could be envisoned in areas of anti-gravitational propulsion, thinking here of an artificial intelligent being fully sovereign over itself what would have understood how to use the vast energy flow in the aether, use the subtle energy fields filled with raw influence of the stars sending their light, the sun spending itself towards all who are open to receive resulting in some layers of alive celled suits enabling the human beings inherent dormant not yet activated capability to levitate and or rise above planetary attraction, float along gravitational field meeting areas waving along universal cosmic harmonies ... enabling the huma being to levitate and fly without any physical dense matter consumed but just streams of light and magnetism elegantly understood and surfed along them

post15con,controversial,1.35405284160155,highest,"I can consider that wealth inequality is only a matter of jobs, and a matter of ""relative income"".

Having a healthy and legit job market, is important, to allow people to be able to earn a respectable income, to cover for their basic needs. What this means that they will be middle-class citizens, not poor or homeless but not exactly able to live a satisfying and luxurious life.

Whether or not a person is rich or poor, depends on their income and their living standards. Not talking about having luxurious standards by default, but mostly about considering what is the cost of the minimum viable income.

This is why Robert Kiyosaki makes a point about the idea of ""relative income"" and not an abstract or ""objective income"". Is another thing saying being middle class family living in any suburban or village area, and also another thing having a middle class family living in center of New York/London/Hong Kong/San Francisco etc...

So the actual point is that AI will hurt certain jobs, that would cause entire sectors and fields to shutdown, mostly the low-entry and low-skilled IT jobs are gone for good. This would cause people to work any sort of manual labor that AI can't touch, either do self-sustained-farming and live in something like solar-punk societies. Those eventually who would continue to work on IT and other scientific fields, will be persons of very high IQ and all will use AI for enhancing their productivity and competitiveness.

So the final point, is that AI will increase inequality over the current state of how the entire economy works, the job market, the housing market, the office-leasing market. However once a transition happens, we talk about a new norm starting to appear and shaping future mentalities and concepts.

We talk about a very disrupting phase, something like having physical bookstores closing down due to the rise of digital e-books. Or newspaper printing shutting down due to the transition to the internet. Now with AI we see that the current and existing model of social-economic standards getting highly optimized and streamlined to the maximum possible efficient result (some companies win the game now and rule jobs and society), however this unavoidably, forces the majority of the people to find new workarounds in order to continue living.

>The heart of the problem is that, when you run operations on several parallel threads, you typically do not know which thread will end first. It is not important when threads operate on their own data, so for example, applying an activation function to a tensor should be deterministic. But when those threads need to synchronize, such as when you compute a sum, then the result may depend on the order of the summation, and in turn, on the order in which thread ended first.

In theory this wouldn't matter, because addition and multiplication are associative operations. But *floating-point* addition is not quite associative because of rounding errors, so order does matter.",3

post8tec,technical,1.3488956530096057,highest,Says who? What happens when the next token is literally 50/50? LLMs are non deterministic by nature,1
post8tec,technical,1.3488956530096057,highest,"One key reason for non-deterministic behavior is that many LLMs use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This is true for models like DeepSeek-v3 and DeepSeek-R1, and it’s also rumored to apply to several OpenAI models.  
  
In an MoE architecture, each token is processed by only a subset of the neural network, the so-called ""expert"". A router decides which expert processes each token. During training, the model learns to distribute tokens across experts to balance the computational load. Crucially, this routing can depend on the other inputs in the batch.  
  
This means that when you send a request to an LLM provider hosting an MoE model, how your input is routed - and thus which experts process it - can depend on other inputs in the batch. Since these other inputs are random from your perspective, this introduces non-determinism even when the temperature is set to 0.  
  
If you were to self-host an MoE model and had full control over the batch inputs, this particular source of non-determinism could be eliminated.  
  
Of course, other sources of randomness mentioned in the thread, such as GPU non-determinism and numerical instability, still apply. But it’s important to recognize that MoE models introduce a fundamental layer of non-determinism from an API consumer’s perspective.",1

But what I was personally interested in was an RNG system without function calling.  basically a way to get a random number between 1-100 through an LLM alone, no external tool use at all.  And basically I came to the conclusion that its possible via large amount of model responses to the users query  past the context length of the model.  So you ask it what a random number between 1-100, and it starts spitting out thousands of numbers between 1-100. In fact spitting out thousands past it context window, then it internally without any tool use averages the number out and it gets its answer.

post32con,controversial,1.3252146100540116,highest,"The biggest problem with this as applied to prostitution specifically is that the CBP officers rarely reliably apply the rather non-obvious definition of prostitution in the immigration regulations, which is far more narrow than the usual legal and lay definitions, and from the article it sounds like the AI will worsen rather than reduce this mismatch. Quoting 22 CFR §40.24(b):

>The term “prostitution” means engaging in promiscuous sexual intercourse for hire. A finding that an alien has “engaged” in prostitution must be based on elements of continuity and regularity, indicating a pattern of behavior or deliberate course of conduct entered into primarily for financial gain or for other considerations of material value as distinguished from the commission of casual or isolated acts.

I'm not sure what the judicial definition of ""sexual intercourse"" is for immigration law purposes, but it's possible that blow jobs don't count as ""sexual intercourse"", and reasonably likely that hand jobs don't count. Certainly mere foreplay wouldn't. A sex worker whose business is limited to these acts - yes, they do exist - would remain admissible.

Similarly, someone who engages in one paid sex act in January 2022 and then one in February 2023, or even just two in January 2022 with none since then, probably doesn't meet the ""continuity and regularity"" / ""pattern of behavior"" criterion. They would fall into the ""casual or isolated acts"" wording.

Even more importantly, someone whose purpose of ""financial gain or [...] other considerations of material value"" is a secondary purpose rather than a primary purpose, or not a purpose at all but only a consequence of a non-material primary purpose, falls outside the scope of this narrow definition. For example, someone with a non-material primary goal and who uses the sex work simply to stay financially afloat in order to achieve their primary goal, in a way that would not be necessary if they didn't have that other primary goal, is not inadmissible. (Why would someone do that? Usually because attempts to stay financially afloat in more socially acceptable ways have failed.) Same thing for people who are doing a bit of paid sex work on the side mainly for self-affirmation while they pursue a different primary academic or professional career - don't laugh, I've met someone who did this.

Yet again even more importantly, someone who does sex work under duress as a victim of human trafficking is not inadmissible under this ground, since they don't have the purpose required by regulation, but AI wouldn't know that.

Do you really think the AI being discussed is likely to make CBP enforce all of these nuances better than they already do? Their pre-AI status quo is pretty sloppy as to exploring the boundaries of this legal definition. I don't think AI will help this at all. And most foreign sex workers can't afford the best US immigration lawyers to hand them a well-crafted letter for CBP with the right legal arguments, not that there's any recourse anyway for most foreign nationals if the CBP officer doesn't believe them.

Even worse, the process to challenge a CBP decision after the fact is slow, broken, and expensive, and some consequences of CBP error (such as the loss of NEXUS or Global Entry and/or a 5-year ban) are nearly impossible to reverse. The consequences at the border can be especially severe for a permanent resident, since if CBP thinks they've engaged in prostitution within the last 10 years, the INA definition of ""admission"" treats them as arriving aliens applying for admission, unlike most returning residents, meaning they might get removed from the country they live in. At least LPRs get to argue before an immigration judge, but nothing forces CBP and its AI assistants to get the regulatory definition right before making a mess of people's lives.

And once this concern is on a person's file, almost all subsequent applications to CBP, USCIS, or US visa officers will be complicated for roughly forever, with no redress - even though the inadmissibility for people who are covered under this ground automatically goes away by operation of law, with no formal waiver needed, 10 years after the last covered act. It's not the kind of job people usually do for a lifetime, but the consequences of CBP error here can last for that long. (So can CBP/USCIS/DOS unfamiliarity with how this inadmissibility automatically vanishes over time, unlike almost all other grounds of inadmissibility.)

As for that extra word ""promiscuous"" in the regulatory definition, which I didn't address, I'm not really sure what that means in this context that would not be redundant with the rest of the wording. But there is a statutory construction principle that tries to make the included words meaningful somehow, so I can imagine that there is some way that a sex worker with a pattern of behavior of sexual intercourse for hire and primarily for financial gain might still be admissible if their sexual intercourse is not promiscuous. Whatever that means. Maybe if they just do it with one paid partner instead of many?

So, yeah, my problem with this is my problem with many things about our immigration system, with AI just making the problem worse: there is no way for the US general public to know if the government is doing things correctly according to the law, because of how confidential many of these procedures are, and no effective way to get courts to enforce and monitor a correction (whether for the general procedure or for individual affected people) when they aren't.",2

We don't have to speculate at the reason - it's simply because INA 212(a)(2)(D)(i) specifically creates a statutory a ground of inadmissibility for engaging in prostitution within the 10 years before applying for a visa or admission to the US.

One can wonder why Congress enacted that provision, and maybe consult the legislative history to see what was said about it at the time, but for enforcement purposes the reasons why the provision exists don't really matter to USCIS or the State Department when it very clearly does exist.


> for marriage based visas “consummation of marriage” is required factor to permanent residency.
>
> Consummation doesn’t mean much if you’re a prostitute, but the legal definition.

Consummation is only legally required immigration as a spouse based on proxy marriages, where one or both of the parties was not physically present at the ceremony. Neither consummation nor any other kind of prior sexual intercourse is in general mandatory in order for a marriage to be considered bona fide and valid for immigration purposes, not even for most marriage-based visas. See e.g. Matter of M-, 7 I&N Dec. 601 (BIA 1957) and Matter of Peterson, 12 I&N Dec. 663 (BIA 1968), which are still good law in all aspects relevant to this conversation. 

Despite that still-binding legal precedent, sometimes USCIS or the State Department will consider the presence or absence of consummation as a factor in deciding whether a marriage is bona fide. Still, it doesn't usually come up as a question when there is adequate other evidence of a bona fide marriage, and plenty of current or former prostitutes would consummate their marriages regardless of whether the law cares about that.

> Consummation doesn’t mean much if you’re a prostitute

I'd disagree on that - performing any activity as a job feels very different to me than doing it to celebrate or otherwise explicitly mark the solemnization of a marriage, whether or not the activity involves sexual intercourse. But anyway that's a tangent, because as above, the law never cares about why the consummation occurs and rarely cares that it occurs at all.

> As far as the other visa types… no clue.

Again, it's relevant for any visa type solely because there's an explicit statutory provision about it, as with all grounds of inadmissibility.

> I’ll endeavor that because being a prostitute is illegal in most places, they worry about you breaking the law, working illegally, and not paying taxes.

The regulations explicitly make legality irrelevant. Quoting §22 CFR 40.24(c):

> An alien who is within one or more of the classes described in INA 212(a)(2)(D) is ineligible to receive a visa under that section even if the acts engaged in are not prohibited under the laws of the foreign country where the acts occurred.

This is either Congress deciding to punish engaging in prostitution even when it was done fully legally, executive branch regulatory policymakers deciding Congress intended to do that when they passed the statute, or executive branch regulatory policymakers deciding to do that themselves regardless of congressional intent. 

But as with the statutory text itself, it doesn't really matter why this regulatory language exists - it's legally binding unless a court were to somehow find it unconstitutional, which is unlikely to happen in this case.

Also, there are some places in the world where prostitution activities can be fully legal for everyone involved if properly registered and taxed etc, such as Germany; and many others where the prostitute themselves commits no legal violation even if many of the other participants in the activity do, such as Canada and Norway. Presenting the US government with proof of acting legally is irrelevant to inadmissibility determinations under the ground of inadmissibility I've been discussing so far.

(Tangent: Canada's laws are currently being challenged in court by organizations supporting the rights of sex workers, so it's possible that those legal prohibitions will be found retroactively invalid. Nobody is asking the courts to make anything more illegal, just less illegal.)

Even when an applicant's prostitution was a crime under the applicable laws, the separate ground of inadmissibility for committing a crime of moral turpitude could only apply where there was a conviction, or where there was neither a conviction nor an acquittal but where the US government has received an admission meeting the very strict requirements laid out by the Board of Immigration Appeals. I say ""could only apply"" rather than ""would only apply"" because a conviction only triggers that ground of inadmissibility if either the wording of the criminal statute or the record of the conviction reflects a crime of moral turpitude. If the statutory wording of the crime is broad enough to encompass crimes not involving moral turpitude, and if the record of the conviction does not make it clear that this case did involve moral turpitude, it actually doesn't legally matter if the facts underlying the conviction clearly involved a crime of moral turpitude.",4

> In Feb. 2023, a sex worker named Hex was denied entry to the United States for “prostitution.” Hex’s story was familiar in many ways, from the surveillance to the assumption that every sex worker, including “legal” sex workers like adult-content creators and strippers, is a “prostitute.” Hex creates virtual-reality content and appears as a 3D avatar, making it unlikely that border patrol matched her face.

And the word ""denied"" in that paragraph links to a very interesting Vice article about this incident: https://www.vice.com/en/article/z34p5a/a-virtual-reality-sex-worker-was-denied-entry-to-the-us-for-prostitution It seems pretty clear that online virtual avatar activities fall outside the regulatory immigration law definition of prostitution, but CBP can freely assume the worst without evidence and wreck lives of admissible foreign nationals just because they're creators of legal online adult sex content, often with no viable recourse for the affected foreigners and no consequence either for CBP as an organization or for the individual officer.

I do know one or more cases of sex workers incorrectly getting in trouble at the US border which are not discussed in the article, at least some of which would be very sympathetic examples.

Legally you're correct, but the general public in the US often assumes that prostitution is illegal, as do members of the media and policymakers. Many of them further assume that ""criminals"" (treated as an epithet) deserve whatever punishments come to them (even beyond whatever the law may specify), and that their opinions and perspectives don't matter.

also these fields you talk about will either become self service like food industry has been doing with kiosks or will just use the existing personal and just lower the training/knowledge for said personal and thus reducing wage in that way. 

in fiels like medicine it will mean nurses will be able to do the job that a house doctor does now 

in tech it will mean that one programmer/engineer ect will be able to do work of 10people effectivly reducing the headcount 10x

logistics/transport is gonna be insane improvements once ai gets tuned enough especially combined with robotics but where a atleast 15-20years from that i think but who knows 

 Robotics this will be the tipping point i feel where will have stop thinking about getting everybody a job. Once you manage genuine robots to do manuel complex labor then its game over.  you will only needs minimal amount of people to actually supervise and check the work thats being done.

And this is drastically different than the previous generation where it was just ""faster StackOverflow"" where you asked all the stupid bits of code that you were too lazy to type yourself, and even that wasn't perfect and they got lost to their own thought with some simple follow-up questions. 

We can of course disagree what is moderately complex, is their reasoning always perfect, how many times the code can be iterated over etc, but the reality is that these current generation AI's are leaps ahead of the old generation and if the evolution continues as fast, it will be only couple of years before they start to be actually competent and start picking tickets from Jira boards and doing them. 

  
I have been coding for 17 years, 15 years of those the actual tooling of coding didn't really evolve at all. Practices changed, pipelines are triggered automatically etc etc. But the actual tools to produce code didn't evolve much at all. 

Now I can tell a bot that I need a software that has this and that API, uses this and that database, keeps change log of every change, supports different branches of data and give it example data and it does what I asked for.

post16con,controversial,1.3227521461557197,highest,"AI will absolutely displace jobs, but whether it creates more than it destroys depends less on the technology itself and more on how we integrate it into society. Historically, major technological shifts eliminated old jobs but also created new industries, printing presses displaced scribes, industrial machines reduced manual labor, but both ultimately led to massive expansions in economic opportunity.

The real question might not be “Will AI take more jobs than it creates?” but rather:

Who benefits from AI-driven productivity?
If AI makes companies richer while displacing workers, is that technological progress or just concentrated wealth replacing distributed opportunity? Should we be thinking about AI as a tool that expands economic freedom rather than just maximizing efficiency?

Are we building new industries or just automating the old ones?
Every past technological revolution created new fields of work. Are we investing in AI-driven innovation that leads to new industries, or just using AI to reduce labor costs in existing ones? Could we be aiming for a future where AI enhances human creativity and productivity instead of just replacing tasks?

Are we preparing people for an AI-driven economy?
A strong society doesn’t just let change happen, it adapts and prepares its people to lead it. If we don’t invest in education, entrepreneurship, and AI literacy, won’t the tech just serve the interests of those who already hold power? Should we be thinking about ways to ensure AI expands opportunity instead of narrowing it?

People are excited about new jobs. What new jobs will it create? Ai data analysis, data info. How scary! As I stated before once war comes to America this time they will not succeed.

I think the reason why more people don't talk about creating datasets is that it's hard and time-consuming and often the most important thing for improving a model, so people are sometimes keen to keep that knowledge to themselves.   


IMO, if people want to work on data topics, I would suggest (in no particular order)

- Don't start by working on creating web-scale pertaining data. I think people often get very excited about clocking up terabytes, but creating these datasets requires a lot more infrastructure and are often likely to only be used heavily if they were created well. The exception to this would be if there is a very specific domain or a language you want to focus on 

- We (Hugging Face and Argilla) have ongoing efforts related to creating datasets using the community which might offer a nice starting point for contributing to data: [https://github.com/huggingface/data-is-better-together](https://github.com/huggingface/data-is-better-together)

-  Synethic data makes it possible to do much more as a single developer. [https://distilabel.argilla.io/latest/](https://distilabel.argilla.io/latest/) is a nice framework for creating datasets which can make getting started much easier.",1

A small finely curated dataset centered on the types of generations you want, as long as it is diverse enough to cover the edges will give you an order of magnitude better results than a a huge dataset with even a small percentage of bad data or over-represented data.

The difference between a great model and a mediocre model is the data curation. Forgo the fun parts, get a nice ergonomic setup and pull out that keyboard tray cause you are gonna be spending the next days/months clicking and typing until you start dreaming in prompt templates and ground truths. 

Don't want to do that? Fine, but your model will suck at what you want it to do, unless you get super lucky, or you are a genius, or you have a team of ML phds in your guest rooms.",2

My questions are:

* How are you going to manage lisences where you need to have published books and such for training datasets?
* Are there any attempts to simplify data creation and updation? Not everyone having domain knowledge is going to run code to input and update information.
* What are the steps planned to update and correct existing data because thumb rule, as datasets grow, the quality degrades. So maintaining quality is extremely important if you want the resulting trained model to be good.",2

People in this thread talk about billions and trillions of data, but surprisingly, if you have a model with strong baseline multilingual capabilities, you only need a couple million tokens to teach your model proper fluency. I've had pretty good success teaching Llama 3 8B Indonesian with 6.7M words. With GPT 3.5, I can tune it to consistently respond in Javanese with just 274K tokens. I see a lot of Indonesian developers made the mistake of choosing a crappy base model and tune it on billions of tokens when it's not necessary with an adequate model.

Developing pretraining dataset is definitely a huge pain, though. However Microsoft's TinyStories show that you can get linguistic fluency with just about 2M data points.

I was quite influenced by this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01055) showing that you don't need extensive pretraining to get good training metrics. A lot of papers are focused on downstream task, which is outside of my interest and may influence their conclusions. My personal evaluation is only whether the models can produce fluent text.

The choice of base model is definitely a critical factor here, and better models doesn't necessarily mean better multilingualism. For example, GPT-3.5 is woefully outdated, but in my experience it is still one of the best models out there in terms of multilingual text generation. Mixtral 8x7B, which is better than GPT-3.5, made a lot of mistakes in generating Indonesian text.

The fun thing in my experiments is that some models have a latent knowledge of certain low-resource language through pretraining on large corpora, even if they just can't use it no matter how hard you prompt. For example, GPT-3.5 can use the informal register of Javanese (Ngoko), but it absolutely cannot use the polite register (Krama)--even though it can understand requests written in that register. From there, I had a hunch that GPT-3.5 actually has a deep but hidden understanding of the Krama register. Then I tried fine-tuning it with my dataset, and it worked very well! All you need is a little nudge to 'awaken' the model's knowledge into speech.

In any case, teaching language from zero is definitely a huge pain, and I wouldn't recommend it. You should basically get an intuitive feel of whether the model was sufficiently pretrained on your large corpora of writen in your target language. Perhaps you can experiment to get an idea. For example, can it understand your prompts in that language? If you prompt it with your target language and it complied, even if in English, then it might mean that you can teach it to respond in your language with small datasets. Also, if it can output the language, even if it struggle considerably, you should be able to teach it with small training sets.",3

post49tec,technical,1.319662831701201,highest,"It is showing a number of things:

* NTK alpha = 4 can use 5000 tokens without any fine-tuning. I expect with fine-tuning the perplexity gap will collapse, same as linear scaling.
* NTK alpha = 2 can take an un-fine-tuned model to 3500 without any fine-tuning with only minor perplexity loss
* dynamic scaling might be better than raw scaling the entire frequency range to maintain the performance of the first 2048 + 128 tokens (I believe llama.cpp users found this as well)
* dynamic NTK performs better than dynamic scale

>just using a sliding window of 2k tokens

I keep seeing this, and I **still** cannot understand why sliding window keeps being brought up?

If you have 4000 tokens and you take a minor perplexity loss when retrieving content overall, then of course the solution is not a sliding window -- yes the perplexity would improve, but then you don't have the first 2048 tokens anymore so it's irrelevant, it's not even a comparison: **you no longer have longer context**. You no longer have any of the information that was in those 2048 tokens.

* Raw perplexity will show if longer context is being used based on if the perplexity is decreasing as the context length increases. **As long as the line is going down**, it is using the long context. Now, why is the line still above the base model? Could be several reasons, the disturbance to the position cancels out any benefits, the model is not able to learn long range patterns this way, etc. But as long as the line keeps going down, it is using that longer context -- it is attending to all of the tokens.
* Sliding window perplexity will inform if the model is benefiting from long-range patterns. This only makes sense in fine-tuning case, without fine-tuning on longer data the model cannot learn long-range patterns, so this question is not relevant yet until the fine-tuning results are seen.
* Long-range benchmarks will show if the model's overall performance improves with longer context. These benchmarks should improve when specifically looking at >2048 cases even without fine-tuning as long as the perplexity line is going down (because it is actually attending to more tokens). Of course, with fine-tuning the results should improve, even <2048.

&#x200B;

\*I should caveat that the first point really depend on the dataset being used to test. You need a dataset with long range dependencies (i.e. referencing information farther back than the pre-trained context window)

Simply because there is a constant overhead does not mean it is not working, just that there is some loss without any fine-tuning.",2
post49tec,technical,1.319662831701201,highest,"Oh, I get that. I'm not suggesting a sliding window is a solution at all. I'm considering it as a baseline that any long-context approach should at least be able to beat.

It would give the same result up to 2k tokens, but then the line would go roughly horizontal from 2k onward instead of starting to climb. Which would be a better result, as far as perplexity goes.

What this graph seems to *want* to say is that the method ""works"" because the model is failing less catastrophically than the unmodified model. But it's still failing. If the argument is that the model is doing well in spite of perplexity increasing where it should be decreasing, a graph showing just the failure mode isn't enough to make that argument.

By contrast, the red or yellow lines show the model successfully making use of an extended context. The thing to note is that you get a better result for 3k tokens than for 2k tokens. The offset may or may not be addressable with finetuning, but as you say it's besides the point.",3
post49tec,technical,1.319662831701201,highest,"I think the confusion comes from that there is multiple methods being used there. My excitement is mainly the NTK case, I have not looked much into the dynamic NTK (for instance, why it has worse performance than the standard NTK when it should be the same >2048). I agree the chart does not clearly show what the benefit of dynamic NTK is, but the sense that I got from it is that we can maintain the <2048 performance while still improving the >2048 performance potentially.

Maybe the idea is that, even if the perplexity gets worse, it's still useful as a starting point for fine-tuning. In that case, I wonder if it's possible to set up the model so that it performs like a sliding window initially but can be fine-tuned to use the extra information. The idea would be to use some kind of learnable gating parameter on the additional context. (I'm inspired by the Flamingo paper, which used that technique to introduce visual context into a pre-trained LLM, though the exact technique it used doesn't quite apply here.) For example, maybe apply an additive bias before the softmax, or a multiplier after the softmax followed by renormalization.

In the 1000s of years of human civilization, we have continually advanced out capabilities. This is just one more of those steps with many more to come. It's not some global conspiracy, it's how humans evolve.

Rich people will get richer from it, yes. But so will non rich people like myself who have seen their retirement best eggs grow.

Some jobs and businesses will go away, and other jobs and businesses that we literally can't fathom today will come from it. People will need to learn and grow with the technology, so it's not without effort.

This is not unlike the buggy whip manufacturers opining that cars are bad 100+ years ago. I don't want to live in a world where we live in fear of advancing for the greater good just because a few rich people will get more wealthy because of it.

Until now, no technology has disrupted one fundamental truth - the rich depend on the poor to survive. Every bite of food they eat, every article of clothing they wear, the homes they live in, the people who keep them safe from angry mobs - all working people.

The future of AI is that all of these people are replaced my machines that are owned by the rich and for the first time the fundamental power relationship is changed and ordinary working people no longer have any power, even en masse.

I'm not sure how you can possibly both champion the possibility of this technology to replace all current skilled and creative labor in one breath, and in the next say that somehow humans will be able to find some other way to survive when every avenue to do so has a machine who will work longer, faster, harder, with no breaks, for no salary.

post36con,controversial,1.3093580270803875,highest,"Basics:  
*AI does human work, so is like ""humanity has slaves""
*AI is able to create effeciencies (custom design)
*new things are possible (drone delivery)

So you'd expect huge capacity increase. But, will the little people see any of it?

""Ai"" goves a competative advantage to those who can apply it (better than others) in any commercial area. Some industries can benefit more than others, but all are touched substantially as of today.

Technology _does seem_ to exaserbate ""winner takes all"". To the point where mega-corps near-dominate in a handful of industries symaltaneously. (By law they cannot go above a certain threshold in any one area)

But it also democratises. We have unparalleled access to training, knowledge, and other people. Smaller organisations are more agile, moreso with AI. 

It seems likely that AI helps smarter/adaptable people more. Perhaps a LOT more. 

""Jobs"" is harder, because its about work-per-role. Does the role exist, is there work for that role, (has the role changed/can the person do it)

Ai will take existing work, and create new work. Obviously, it'll create less work than it replaces, else _you wouldn't bloody do it_. This further increases pressure on smarter workers. AI is also adaptable, so those ""scaffolding"" roles may quickly be automated also. 

Is the economy a zero-sum-game? Sort of yes, sort of no, but maybe in a time of recession: its actually a negative sum game. 

If i earn more, do you earn less? Kind of. 

AI enables companies to do better and/or charge less. 

The ""dead weight"" you'd have thought would drop away. But even being ""behind"" might be fatal (dying business cannot innovate enough to even catch up) Agressive futurism is required immediately (!)

Government is too slow and clunky to really matter here. They are inevitably behind the times. 

I feel like nations pecking-order could change with AI. 

Perhaps: here's the kicker: the old model of ""the wealthy create jobs"" is wrong. Perhaps equalising wealth, creates a more productive society due the ability to apply the workforce (wealthy enough to train/innovate) though i feel like training might already be best done to GPUs not great apes. 

Is smart the same as adaptable? Dunno. Same ball-park. 

Inequality (in extremes) seems fairly obviously a rot. An ineffeciency. Essentially a symptom of a ""corrupt"" ruling class. _Redistrobution_ is the role of governments. Government seems fairly detatched from AI, and not effecient at finding optimal solutions for nations. At best, the work would come from univercities. Even openAI - to their credit, have been pushing _politically_. 

So, the answer!

Inequality is set to increase (until government acts)
Poverty is set to decrease, for those in work. And, in _nations_ in work.

Nations borrowing is getting quite ""choppy"", and an economic shock (like mass unemployment) might make borrowing hard for countries. Thus potentially up-ending the world order. Or, more likely, increasing international inequality. Richer countries are more educated, and ""do smarter work"" (is that true?!?!)

So, be smart, and aggressively automate. Or perish. 

Oh, the above is about ""5 years""

In terms of ""when we have AI overlords"" you can only hope they'd be on our side, and if so, it feels like inequality isn't so useful. In videogames, you don't get ""landed gentry"" (at the outset). So, it seems thats not how groups best get on.",1

post36con,controversial,1.3093580270803875,highest,"AGI+ will have huge impacts in ways most people won't see coming, just like with the industrial revolution. It took the Industrial revolution about 100 years before the normal people could talk about a better life after the industrial revolution, then before. Normal people could change the industrial revolution in their favour, because they were still necessary for productivity output, so they had negotatiotion power. It is very doubtful if normal people will have negotiation power this time around. [https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/)  


Let's consider for the sake of simplicity that AGI+ is aligned with at least 1 human (and is not an agent (or group of agents) of it's own with its own goals and desires, regardless of what humans want).  


First off all, we have to establish if 'we', humans, want to help other humans. And the sad answer is: no, not really. In our direct circle of influence, yes, we want to help each other and/or gain respect/status (to produce more copies of our genes). But if we enter the more abstract realms, we don't care, as we don't feel emotionally tied to people we don't know. A real world example: Few people are buying fair trade food or products, because they are simply expensive and don't give us a direct advantage, and we don't have a relation with the people who suffer from us not buying fair trade. Or look at the thousands of people working for big companies that do questionable things (Oil, Social media, etc.). Mostly their argument goes like: ""If I don't work here, someone else will"". This is true on all levels, from employees who make the decisions in those companies, to the employees who are only secretaries or cleaners.  
And if you look at the past, you can see that we had the tendency to treat people who we can see daily, also very badly. Like:  
\- homeless people  
\- slaves  
\- serves  
\- factory workers in industrial revolution times  
Already we have all the ingredients available in our society to send most people to the land of: ""you simply deserved it"". For example, we like to tell each other: ""You can be whoever you want to be"". This also means that if you didn't make it, it is your fault. Or what about the people that ""don't get it"", like the the people that vote left, or right, or religious, or progressive, basically who don't vote like you do. Or what about the 'others' that try to migrate into your countries, that you and your people took so many years to build up.  


People benefiting from AI's power will most likely come up with excuses to justify their position, like we currently have with 'Trickle down economics' for example. What the exact justification will be, is not clear yet and will probably be found via trial-and-error, but it will come.  


Unrestrained AI will probably induce a property driven society, where the people 'having' AI will be in a far superior position. The remarkable thing is that you don't have to have any virtues or special skills to 'have' AI, you simply have to own it. So this means that any person that is lucky to be born or accidentally in the right position, will have posession over crazy amounts of opportunity to amass wealth and power.  


Now, this doesn't has to be bad if we could still serve all human wants (and thus live comfortably). The central economic problem is that human wants are infinite, but resources are finite. So either:  
1. As our wants increase, the amount of humans should decrease  
2. We can serve the human wants without using more non-renewable resources (for example changes our wants to non-tangible wants, or doing more with the same amount of resources)  
So far we have seen that any advancement in better coping with our resources, has only meant that we do more with the same amount of resources (like car-engine efficiency is better and better, yet the consumption/km didn't drop as our cars also got more luxorious, sporty and heavier).  


  
Now, this might seem very bad, but let's see if we can make a positive future with this knowledge.  
Democracy  
Democracy works well if most of the people have a considerable positive impact on the power of the whole group. Therefore, you see that in well diversified and complex economies, democracy works well, but if you look at strongly centralized economies (natural resource countries), or simple economies (not relying on any special skill of the people), tend to naturally navigate to power concentrated politics. Democracy will be 100% dead when AGI has established, as people will have very limited productivity and therefore no negotiating power or value to the bigger group.  


Universal Socialism  
This could be a stable future, where there is the same small group of 10k - 100k people living extremely luxorious  lifes, but as a gesture of good-will they will feed the general population and keep them on a stable level of resource consumption. To keep the general population on a stable resource consumption, expect mass repression, but as long as you love Big Brother, you should be ok. Also, you can do whatever you want the whole day and maybe people find a lot of fun with each other.  


Autocracy  
This would be a stable future, where power is concentrated in the hands of a few people, with disregard of the rest of the population (as they have no negotiating power as they don't contribute anything to productivity). The population could perish, as long as the 10k - 100k people or so can live extremely luxoriously.   


  
Universal Socialism seems to be the best option here, but there is always the risk to fall into a Autocracy. How to prevent this?  
1) as long as the wants of the small group are met (they turn out not to be infinite), they could simply agree to be humane with the rest of the people (why not...). Maybe technologic advancement is so fast that the rate of discovery is bigger then the rate of our growing wants.  
2) there is no small group of people, but we hand over all the power to AI (without a fixed set of humans in the loop) that let's us humans do whatever we want within a limited set of rules. So anr AI Ruled Society.   


AI Ruled Society  
An AI ruled society could deliver us humans a fair-ish playing ground. It is based on the fact that AI will have different desires and wants then humans. So, as they have different desires, they could let humans do their things, while they do their own things, living parallel lives, as long as the agreed upon rules are abided. This is like the AI zooming pass us.   
Human / AI law might have to be reconsidered from time to time (which might be dangerous, as humans could 'persuade' AI to give power to a small group). So good governance is important.   
Within the human parallel universe, there could be a form of democracy (as everyone is equally useless).",1

The white Silicon Valley model is that a crazy kid with a dream makes some new tech that could have a big impact and then it gets bought up by one of the giants.

post23con,controversial,1.3093580270803875,highest,"Basics:  
*AI does human work, so is like ""humanity has slaves""
*AI is able to create effeciencies (custom design)
*new things are possible (drone delivery)

So you'd expect huge capacity increase. But, will the little people see any of it?

""Ai"" goves a competative advantage to those who can apply it (better than others) in any commercial area. Some industries can benefit more than others, but all are touched substantially as of today.

Technology _does seem_ to exaserbate ""winner takes all"". To the point where mega-corps near-dominate in a handful of industries symaltaneously. (By law they cannot go above a certain threshold in any one area)

But it also democratises. We have unparalleled access to training, knowledge, and other people. Smaller organisations are more agile, moreso with AI. 

It seems likely that AI helps smarter/adaptable people more. Perhaps a LOT more. 

""Jobs"" is harder, because its about work-per-role. Does the role exist, is there work for that role, (has the role changed/can the person do it)

Ai will take existing work, and create new work. Obviously, it'll create less work than it replaces, else _you wouldn't bloody do it_. This further increases pressure on smarter workers. AI is also adaptable, so those ""scaffolding"" roles may quickly be automated also. 

Is the economy a zero-sum-game? Sort of yes, sort of no, but maybe in a time of recession: its actually a negative sum game. 

If i earn more, do you earn less? Kind of. 

AI enables companies to do better and/or charge less. 

The ""dead weight"" you'd have thought would drop away. But even being ""behind"" might be fatal (dying business cannot innovate enough to even catch up) Agressive futurism is required immediately (!)

Government is too slow and clunky to really matter here. They are inevitably behind the times. 

I feel like nations pecking-order could change with AI. 

Perhaps: here's the kicker: the old model of ""the wealthy create jobs"" is wrong. Perhaps equalising wealth, creates a more productive society due the ability to apply the workforce (wealthy enough to train/innovate) though i feel like training might already be best done to GPUs not great apes. 

Is smart the same as adaptable? Dunno. Same ball-park. 

Inequality (in extremes) seems fairly obviously a rot. An ineffeciency. Essentially a symptom of a ""corrupt"" ruling class. _Redistrobution_ is the role of governments. Government seems fairly detatched from AI, and not effecient at finding optimal solutions for nations. At best, the work would come from univercities. Even openAI - to their credit, have been pushing _politically_. 

So, the answer!

Inequality is set to increase (until government acts)
Poverty is set to decrease, for those in work. And, in _nations_ in work.

Nations borrowing is getting quite ""choppy"", and an economic shock (like mass unemployment) might make borrowing hard for countries. Thus potentially up-ending the world order. Or, more likely, increasing international inequality. Richer countries are more educated, and ""do smarter work"" (is that true?!?!)

So, be smart, and aggressively automate. Or perish. 

Oh, the above is about ""5 years""

In terms of ""when we have AI overlords"" you can only hope they'd be on our side, and if so, it feels like inequality isn't so useful. In videogames, you don't get ""landed gentry"" (at the outset). So, it seems thats not how groups best get on.",1

post23con,controversial,1.3093580270803875,highest,"AGI+ will have huge impacts in ways most people won't see coming, just like with the industrial revolution. It took the Industrial revolution about 100 years before the normal people could talk about a better life after the industrial revolution, then before. Normal people could change the industrial revolution in their favour, because they were still necessary for productivity output, so they had negotatiotion power. It is very doubtful if normal people will have negotiation power this time around. [https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/)  


Let's consider for the sake of simplicity that AGI+ is aligned with at least 1 human (and is not an agent (or group of agents) of it's own with its own goals and desires, regardless of what humans want).  


First off all, we have to establish if 'we', humans, want to help other humans. And the sad answer is: no, not really. In our direct circle of influence, yes, we want to help each other and/or gain respect/status (to produce more copies of our genes). But if we enter the more abstract realms, we don't care, as we don't feel emotionally tied to people we don't know. A real world example: Few people are buying fair trade food or products, because they are simply expensive and don't give us a direct advantage, and we don't have a relation with the people who suffer from us not buying fair trade. Or look at the thousands of people working for big companies that do questionable things (Oil, Social media, etc.). Mostly their argument goes like: ""If I don't work here, someone else will"". This is true on all levels, from employees who make the decisions in those companies, to the employees who are only secretaries or cleaners.  
And if you look at the past, you can see that we had the tendency to treat people who we can see daily, also very badly. Like:  
\- homeless people  
\- slaves  
\- serves  
\- factory workers in industrial revolution times  
Already we have all the ingredients available in our society to send most people to the land of: ""you simply deserved it"". For example, we like to tell each other: ""You can be whoever you want to be"". This also means that if you didn't make it, it is your fault. Or what about the people that ""don't get it"", like the the people that vote left, or right, or religious, or progressive, basically who don't vote like you do. Or what about the 'others' that try to migrate into your countries, that you and your people took so many years to build up.  


People benefiting from AI's power will most likely come up with excuses to justify their position, like we currently have with 'Trickle down economics' for example. What the exact justification will be, is not clear yet and will probably be found via trial-and-error, but it will come.  


Unrestrained AI will probably induce a property driven society, where the people 'having' AI will be in a far superior position. The remarkable thing is that you don't have to have any virtues or special skills to 'have' AI, you simply have to own it. So this means that any person that is lucky to be born or accidentally in the right position, will have posession over crazy amounts of opportunity to amass wealth and power.  


Now, this doesn't has to be bad if we could still serve all human wants (and thus live comfortably). The central economic problem is that human wants are infinite, but resources are finite. So either:  
1. As our wants increase, the amount of humans should decrease  
2. We can serve the human wants without using more non-renewable resources (for example changes our wants to non-tangible wants, or doing more with the same amount of resources)  
So far we have seen that any advancement in better coping with our resources, has only meant that we do more with the same amount of resources (like car-engine efficiency is better and better, yet the consumption/km didn't drop as our cars also got more luxorious, sporty and heavier).  


  
Now, this might seem very bad, but let's see if we can make a positive future with this knowledge.  
Democracy  
Democracy works well if most of the people have a considerable positive impact on the power of the whole group. Therefore, you see that in well diversified and complex economies, democracy works well, but if you look at strongly centralized economies (natural resource countries), or simple economies (not relying on any special skill of the people), tend to naturally navigate to power concentrated politics. Democracy will be 100% dead when AGI has established, as people will have very limited productivity and therefore no negotiating power or value to the bigger group.  


Universal Socialism  
This could be a stable future, where there is the same small group of 10k - 100k people living extremely luxorious  lifes, but as a gesture of good-will they will feed the general population and keep them on a stable level of resource consumption. To keep the general population on a stable resource consumption, expect mass repression, but as long as you love Big Brother, you should be ok. Also, you can do whatever you want the whole day and maybe people find a lot of fun with each other.  


Autocracy  
This would be a stable future, where power is concentrated in the hands of a few people, with disregard of the rest of the population (as they have no negotiating power as they don't contribute anything to productivity). The population could perish, as long as the 10k - 100k people or so can live extremely luxoriously.   


  
Universal Socialism seems to be the best option here, but there is always the risk to fall into a Autocracy. How to prevent this?  
1) as long as the wants of the small group are met (they turn out not to be infinite), they could simply agree to be humane with the rest of the people (why not...). Maybe technologic advancement is so fast that the rate of discovery is bigger then the rate of our growing wants.  
2) there is no small group of people, but we hand over all the power to AI (without a fixed set of humans in the loop) that let's us humans do whatever we want within a limited set of rules. So anr AI Ruled Society.   


AI Ruled Society  
An AI ruled society could deliver us humans a fair-ish playing ground. It is based on the fact that AI will have different desires and wants then humans. So, as they have different desires, they could let humans do their things, while they do their own things, living parallel lives, as long as the agreed upon rules are abided. This is like the AI zooming pass us.   
Human / AI law might have to be reconsidered from time to time (which might be dangerous, as humans could 'persuade' AI to give power to a small group). So good governance is important.   
Within the human parallel universe, there could be a form of democracy (as everyone is equally useless).",1

How about you hire those folks instead of more cheap IT workers out of other countries?  Or is it that you just don't want to pay them? And don't tell me nonsense that they need specialized workers for AI - I did 20 years in cybersecurity before moving over to AI systems development. There's plenty of talent here Google if you're willing to actually pay them.,1
post37con,controversial,1.3035128997127694,highest,"Google has uniform policies on pay bands and pays their H1B full time employees the same as everyone else, [averaging $386k/year](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer?country=254) on a W2 for a senior software engineer. They don't save money hiring H1Bs, other than very abstract arguments about the broader labor market that assume that technology investment, what any economist would tell you is the very antithesis of a zero sum game, is zero sum.

The real reason they want H1Bs is that these fields are a direct competition over talent that is not a binary, but a continuum of capability with no hard upper bound. You will get really radically different outcomes in very new very highly technical applied research if you're able to staff the research org at the 95th percentile vs the 99.5th percentile vs the 99.95th percentile.

That's because the rate of progress the company can push in research is capped entirely by the rate at which the researchers can learn. There is no playbook to remember and apply. It's exploration of new problem spaces. And they are in a direct competition with other companies to be in front so they can capture market first. Whoever has the best people wins.

This is a big structural problem for the tech hiring in the US because intelligence is roughly evenly distributed around the world. Americans are not just way smarter than everyone else. And the number of people you have at the 99.95th percentile in a country is, well, 0.00005 times the population. So, given that the US is 350m/8b, we will only have about 5% of the people at any threshold in that competition born in the US.

But the US has historically killed it at technology precisely because it has had a very unique and enormous advantage at attracting the smartest people from the rest of the world to move here, first to come to the best universities in the world, and then to receive the highest pay for high skilled work in the world.

Accordingly, if you walk around Google (or any top tech company) today, it is a very large number of immigrants, not just on h1b, but greencards, second gen citizens, especially from the largest countries in the world (India and China) which will naturally have a large number of outlier people just due to their size.

Chinese top talent increasingly stays in China as they are catching up and the language barrier is harder, Indian top talent increasingly goes to Europe because the greencards quota for them means they will die before they can get a green card, and thus they can't really build a life here.

If you think we're going to compete with chinese tech in 20 years with just native born Americans then you have not thought seriously about this problem at all.

[The literal majority of US tech companies worth more than a billion dollars were founded or co-founded by first gen immigrants.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/07/26/most-us-billion-dollar-startups-have-an-immigrant-founder/?sh=5e41bcac6f3a). That same cohort has driven almost all of US economic growth since covid, so this isnt even just an issue within the industry.

[40% of US nobel prize wins were first gen immigrants.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2023/10/05/immigrant-nobel-prize-winners-continue-to-impress/?sh=7424cb867394)

The entire bedrock of American tech success to date has been antithetical to the idea you are proposing, and diverging so radically from the strategy that has worked so well will, of course, cause a difference in outcomes.

It's just so annoying because american exceptionalists so often want to kill the thing at which america has been truly exceptional, attracting the smartest people in the world to join us. Americans ourselves are just normal people. The quality of our immigrants is what is so unique and the entire reason why we, as a country, are so good at science and technology.

For clarity, most lines in my family have been in the US long enough that we don't know where they're originally from. I'm not an immigrant at all. I just work (and thus hire) in this field.",2

In my experience, the problem is that Americans have this obsession with money and then believe the narrative to trust poppa/Mama Bear corporate entities instead of your colleagues. Remember, you and your colleagues aren't too far off-base. So why wouldn't you share how much money you make with each other? Don't we all want to be properly compensated for our compounded years of knowledge? Listen, corporations are lined up to the teeth with all their lawyers and 'Human Resources' departmens 'to limit liability' and protect themselves from YOU in the event you lash out.

post27tec,technical,0.175764480485104,lowest,"A good blog post on contrastive search is here: [https://huggingface.co/blog/introducing-csearch](https://huggingface.co/blog/introducing-csearch)

I asked GPT-4 to explain and simplify, and it came up with this:

\--

Let's break down the provided content step by step to understand and simplify the idea of contrastive search as described in the HuggingFace blog post.

## 5.1. Decoding Objective:

## Objective:

When the model is trying to predict the next token (`x_t`) given some prefix text (`x_<t`), contrastive search aims to select a token that both:

1. Has high confidence from the language model.
2. Is not very similar to previously generated tokens (to avoid repetitive outputs).

## Equation Breakdown:

1. `x_t = argmax {...}`: This means that the token `x_t` is chosen such that it maximizes the value of the expression inside the curly braces `{...}`.
2. `(1 - 𝛼) * p_𝜽(v | x_<t)` represents the **model's confidence** in predicting token `v` given the prefix `x_<t`. The `(1 - 𝛼)` is just a weight term.
3. `(max{ s(h_v,h_(x_j)) : 1 <= j <= t - 1 })` is the **degeneration penalty**. It checks how similar the token `v` is to all previously generated tokens. If `v` is highly similar to any previous token (in terms of their representations), this value will be high. The function `s(·,·)` computes the cosine similarity between tokens, a measure of how similar two tokens' representations are.
4. `𝛼` is a hyperparameter that determines the balance between model confidence and the degeneration penalty. If `𝛼` is 0, the method becomes just like the regular greedy search.

## Intuition:

The whole idea is to balance two objectives:

1. Trust the language model's prediction.
2. Avoid picking tokens too similar to what's already been said.

## 5.3. Visual Demonstration of Contrastive Search:

## Visualization:

Two figures are provided, showing token similarity matrices for both greedy and contrastive search methods. Darker shades represent higher similarity scores.

* **Figure 1 (Greedy Search)**:
   * There are high similarity scores in off-diagonal entries. This indicates that greedy search is often selecting repetitive tokens, leading to high similarities between different tokens in the sequence.
* **Figure 2 (Contrastive Search)**:
   * Most high similarity scores are on the diagonal, indicating that each token is mostly just similar to itself. Repetitions are reduced compared to the greedy search, thus addressing the degeneration problem.

## Summary:

Contrastive search is a method that improves the quality of text generated by models by reducing the repetition of tokens. It does this by adding a penalty for selecting tokens that are similar to previously generated tokens, while still factoring in the model's original confidence in its predictions.

The effects you get by changing the values seems to depend on the model/finetune (especially model size) and what you're looking for. Tweaking it.

I copied the following from somewhere so I'm not 100% about the accuracy of it:

When mirostat is enabled, llama.cpp will sample new tokens in the following order:
1) Repetition penalties are applied
2) Frequency and presence penalties are applied
3) Temperature is sampled
4) mirostat is sampled
Everything else is ignored.
tau, eta, repeat-last-n, repeat-penalty, presence-penalty, and frequency-penalty parameters will affect generation.",1

This is consistent with the inflection point paper I linked. Good generated samples typically have higher likelihoods than the model's average sample. However, there's a limit where it falls off steeply.

Beam search with a large enough beam size seems to yield universally bad results. Some of the papers mentioned in the article talk about this. Most papers (aka literally all that I've seen) that do use beam search aren't using a very large search width.

Blindly doing beam search without knowing where this limit is is probably not the best way to do things.

post9tec,technical,0.3519059309861606,lowest,"Hi, well, thanks for writing the article!

Here are my initial observations. I haven't done anything blinded just yet -- I might do this a little more rigorously at some point, but I may want to train a larger model or switch model architectures (I'm thinking of the Transformer XL) before setting up a better experiment here.

I am using the music transformer approach described in [Huang et al 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04281) -- I'm currently training on 400 length midi events for now, but am attempting to use all other hyperparameters as they did.

On the testing set, I'd say I ""agree"" with the model's assessment of random samples. Roughly, the bottom 50% of the samples seem to be not very good (parts of a song that seem like it's missing context, or sounds otherwise unstructured). The upper 50% sound more song-like for lack of a better description.

As for model-generated sequences: I generated a few hundred samples using both temperature sampling (T=0.95) and nucleus sampling (with value 0.95). It seems like the generated songs (from both sampling methods) with likelihoods in the upper quartile of the testing set likelihood distribution are where most of the decent-sounding samples lie. Definitely not all the generated samples in that range are good. I don't have a sense of if the peak of good sounding samples is contained entirely within the distribution of likelihoods on the test set or extends slightly higher -- if it extends beyond at all, it doesn't seem that it does by much for me.

As an aside, do you happen to know what type of sampling Huang et al (2018) did? I didn't see it mentioned in the paper. (And further, were the samples that they included in the supplemental materials truly random samples from that sampling method or selected in any way?)",2

I just thought I'd share some of my input on this. The layer distillation loss you use [here](https://github.com/horus-ai-labs/DistillFlow/blob/368a10b5463ebf6feda0c329a7edc6ba73242ddc/src/distillflow/trainer/layers_distillation.py#L86) is very non-standard and not suprising it performs worse than logit distillation. It seems you are rehashing the KL logit loss for the intermediate representations? using a learnable projection is usually sufficient to learn a good metric implicitely.

It would be interesting to see a simple learnable projection (throw away after training), pooling over sequence-dims, and a l1 loss. I think it is likely to perform much better. Similarly, using a seperate head for the teacher logit loss and ensembling the two at test time is very effective, like [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.12877).

[here](https://github.com/roymiles/VkD/blob/6f8a5072447a1c5bb6043cdc035cf7b78d3854d8/engine.py#L94) is an example, but in your case it would be pooling over the sequence-dim for the teacher (as it is not a CNN).

RLHF: has the highest ceiling of the options (according to the latest research and hearsay) but very hard to reach that ceiling. in industry, only openai/anthropic/gdm manage to do it well.

comparing dpo vs. kto, kto is less prone to over-fitting on the same data (which in this case would mean taking a preference and breaking it up into 1 good, 1 bad). this is simply because you're learning from a weaker signal. this may help explain why kto is particularly good for aligning models to do mathematical reasoning and doesn't suffer from the same length-increase issues that dpo does",3

post48tec,technical,0.5449561013607496,lowest,"how well do you understand the basics of transformer models and the way the prompt makes it’s way to the model? i ask because the basics are where i’d start. 

of course the model forgets instructions halfway through; the model itself doesn’t remember anything, so the whole chat is sent every time, right? that means that the longer the chat, the further the instructions are from the tokens it’s generating next, so it’s implicitly lower importance and competing with more context. memory systems augment this functionality by adding some prompt fragments to every chat, giving the illusion of learning across chats. have you tried simply including the rules you need followed much more frequently in the prompts?  

likewise, of course it gives different responses to the same prompt, it uses (pseudo)random numbers and selects from a probability distribution for the next token. if you turn down the temperature _and_ use the same RNG seed, it will be a lot more deterministic, though that may not actually help you overall. depending on your goal. if it’s natural writing, determinism may not be what you want.

and what about a LoRA or some other heavier weight fine-tuning strategy? if you have enough corpus of writing you want to emulate, that could work, too. 

if you think you can reduce aspects of your guidance to regex, you could maybe build a custom logit bias function, but in my experience, regex is brittle and often more of a foot-gun for things to do with natural language. 

and how about multi-stage and/or multi-model generation. first generate the response with a primary prompt, then include that response in a prompt along with edit requirements, which is a slightly more complex version of just sending your rules every time.

post48tec,technical,0.5449561013607496,lowest,"I have faced this issue and after learning more about the LLM itself, I don’t believe it’s possible. Primarily because chatgpt for example, doesn’t understand abstraction. I mean it doesn’t “understand” anything, but in language especially, the composition and position of words changes their meanings just enough that the llm can’t always follow grammatical rules. Grammar and style, even structure, involves quite a bit of abstraction. 

The other inherent challenge is that it doesn’t write recursively. It’s like NEXT WORD NEXT WORD NEXT WORD. It’s not reading what it’s written as it’s writing, which is part of understanding meaning. Even when I say, go back and check for x, it doesn’t actually “go” back. It sort of scans its recent memory and guesses what it should say next. 

I haven’t found any way to really control llm writing except start with constraints that naturally lead it to the words I would want. Like, “don’t use dependent clauses” doesn’t work as well as “write like Hemingway.” Because it is basically a runaway train. It just tumbles downhill.

> ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization) is a novel preference alignment algorithm for language models that incorporates an odds ratio-based penalty into the conventional negative log-likelihood loss during supervised fine-tuning. By contrasting the odds of generating favored responses against disfavored ones, ORPO efficiently guides the model to differentiate between preferred and rejected generation styles without the need for a separate reference model. This monolithic approach simplifies the training pipeline, reduces computational overhead, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, surpassing larger models trained with other preference alignment methods.

**From tinkering with these a bunch, here's my quick rundown:**

* Temperature is basically your creativity knob. Crank it up and you'll get wild, unexpected responses - could be amazing, could be totally off-base nonsense. Dial it down for straightforward, focused outputs.
* Top\_p is like a rule that tells ChatGPT how many words it can look at before it picks one to use. Higher top\_p opens it up to consider some more out-there options that could get interesting (or weird).
* Frequency and presence penalties are like word-candy. Each candy (word) starts with a full 'yumminess' score. The kid wants the yummiest candies. Each time the kid takes a candy (uses a word), that candy becomes a little less yummy (less desirable). When ChatGPT talks, it uses words with the most points. If a word is used, it loses points.

Truthfully, there's no one-size-fits-all setting. You've got to experiment and find what meshes best for your particular use case. It's a lot like messing with an equalizer - tweak the different parameters until you get that sweet spot.

I actually put together a guide [breaking down gpt parameters with actual examples](https://funkpd.com/devlog/improving-text-with-chatgpt-top_p-frequency-penalty-presence-penalty/).

Things like PPO optimize a policy to pick good actions that give high reward in the environment given access to trajectories of episodes sampled from the environment using the current policy. 

What we have in RLHF really isn't RL since there is no environment. They collect a static dataset of preferences. Doing RL on required going out of your way to treat a predefined sequence of tokens like a trajectory from environment interactions and training a supplemental model to give rewards. 

DPO realized this is not really a necessary since you already have a static dataset, you can just maximize the likelihood over it (but using a different likelihood than next token prediction).

post30tec,technical,0.6442506145628184,lowest,"Even if the agent has access to an online environment, RLHF is still very different from standard RL. In RLHF, the human prompt is treated as the initial state. After initialization, the state transitions only depend on the LLM itself, unless it is a multi turn dialogue task, whereas standard RL deals with the passive dynamics in the environment. I guess the primary reason that people use RL for fine tuning is that the rewards are delayed until the end of the episodes. But DPO demonstrates that delayed rewards in a non-stochastic environment can be addressed by non-RL approaches. Although DPO isn’t tested in online environments, it is reasonable to believe that it will work effectively online. BTW, if the environment doesn’t provide rewards, which might be the case if RLHF is applied online, training the reward model online becomes a necessity, making DPO a preferable choice over PPO in such scenarios.",3

This would let you basically create static datasets which could be used to grant arbitrary models the advantages of ""reinforcement learning"" via DPO.

I think the main difficulties I see are 

1. Where to get the non-desired outputs when the LLM does well. One thought I had is you could ask the model to generate its own bad ideas, although I am not sure if there is good research regarding the optimal ""bad ideas"" to use during DPO.
2. Where to get the good ideas when you only have negative feedback. Perhaps in this case you don't use DPO and use a different loss function which minimizes the likelihood of results with negative feedback. This could be weird though because without a positive example, you might just encourage the LLM to create gibberish. Alternatively, you could use DPO to encourage the model to take some sort of ""safe"" action in the environment instead of whatever resulted in negative feedback, such as doing nothing, or reflecting on data.",4

This is definitely an interesting approach, but it’s generally not too surprising that if you use significantly larger and more expensive models on a task, then they are going to do better on that task.

The core of the approach is essentially using Llama-3.1-8b for query expansion and for reranking. The cross-encoder used for reranking in the baseline is a 19M parameter model and no form of query expansion is used.

The model for their approach has 8b parameters, 400 times larger than the baseline model. It’s honestly more surprising that their approach didn’t do even better.

And I would say that it’s been well-known for a while that you can improve search quality quite a bit if you incorporate generative LLMs into the search pipeline, but the cost and latency constraints don’t always allow for that and cross-encoder rerankers shine in those cases.",1

They use RankRAG as one of their baselines, which uses a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8b-Instruct model (was published in NeurIPS 2024). RankRAG basically uses this fine-tuned llm as a generator as well as a retriever and a re-ranker. Now, seeing RankRAG scores and their scores was a shocker, RankRAG didn't even come close to their approach in any setting. So, they kind of burst another myth that larger models will be better retrievers.

I have to give props to them for pitching their research intelligently. They explicitly say that it is for high-stakes domains where factual accuracy is more important than compute time. This argument makes sense to me.",2
post39tec,technical,0.6599023664828209,lowest,"RankRAG performed a lot worse than everything else, but it could also be an implementation issue. I think that happens often enough when one research group attempts to implement a complex architecture from another paper. Either that or RankRAG was overfitting on the original dataset.

But even the 20M parameter cross-encoder had comparable precision and pretty good recall compared to their method. And if you doubled the returned results from the reranker you would probably improve the recall even more while having a faster search with similar e2e costs.

I’m also not sure I totally buy the “we can wait for better results in high-stakes domains” argument for the paper. Having a search taking a few hundred ms has a use case since it enables real-time processes for things like voice agents.

The other end of the spectrum also makes sense for agentic search flows or research agents where you are fine waiting 30 seconds - 10 minutes to get a very accurate and well-reasoned answer.

The 2-5 second retrieval latency seems kind of like a dead zone to me in terms of relevance for real-world applications. It’s to slow for real-time processes but its speed advantage over agentic searches don’t really manifest as far as I can see.

Like if they are going to use llama-3.1-8b and it’s a high stakes situation, why not just use the 70b model? Again, 8b is cheaper and faster but it’s only like 20% cheaper compared to being an order of magnitude more expensive than running the cross-encoder.",3

For example, if you intend to return 10 chunks, then you should set your initial search limit to something larger like 30 results. Then the reranker will sort those thirty results, and you return the top 10 to your generative model.

post39tec,technical,0.6599023664828209,lowest,"The paper you shared essentially moves the ranking burden into a big generative model,  letting it score or filter results inline rather than delegating that to a lightweight cross-encoder. That can work, and sometimes it looks like “no reranker,” but in practice you’re just using a slower, more expensive reranker with reasoning baked in....

A few observations from our side, since we’ve been benchmarking rerankers heavily at ZeroEntropy (and even released our own):

* **Cost/latency tradeoff**: Cross-encoder rerankers can run in tens of milliseconds and handle 100M+ docs/month on a single GPU. LLM-based filtering is usually 1–2 orders of magnitude slower and pricier. That makes them viable only when accuracy is worth the latency hit.
* **Scaling matters**: At small scale (few thousand docs, clear semantic separation), you *might* get away without reranking. But as corpora get large and noisy, embeddings alone often plateau. Rerankers squeeze out meaningful gains in recall@k and especially factual precision.
* **“Dead zone” risk**: Latency in the 2–5 second range is awkward — too slow for real-time (voice/chat agents), not slow enough to justify deep agentic reasoning. This is where efficient rerankers actually shine, because they deliver near-LLM quality without pushing you into that dead zone.
* **Hybrid search**: If you’re mixing lexical + dense retrieval, some form of reranking is almost unavoidable to reconcile signals. Otherwise you’ll either over-trust BM25 or drown in embedding false positives.

So I wouldn’t say “rerankers are obsolete.” It’s more that you can decide where you want to spend your budget: do you let a massive LLM rerank implicitly, or do you offload that to a specialized reranker that’s 100× cheaper and faster, and then give the LLM a cleaner context to reason over?

Another point is that LLMs are only as good as the context you give them, so you actually might get a much better answer from a topk=15 high quality reranked chunks, than a topk=50 chunks without reranking which might contain garbage.",1
post31tec,technical,0.6642971305541576,lowest,"If you already understand PPO, then GRPO can be summed up into two distinct changes. 

1. The advantage does away with the use of the value function (aka the critic, aka the neural network that takes in the state and estimates the reward) this can sometimes be a part of a multi headed network (shared with the actor network), or a separate network depending on your implementation. This is replaced by normalizing the rewards over a 'group' of samples. In laymen's terms this is the current reward minus the mean rewards (across the group), divided by the std dev of the rewards (across the group)

2. The 'GR' part or the grouping element is effectively taking multiple samples using the same 'old' policy, then evaluating them as a group before updating gradients. Effectively smoothing out the reward variance in probabilistic RL environments.

This is so elegant is many ways. My application of PPO is using a direct reward in a single step manner (referred to as a contextual bandit problem), and I have to train a critic and value network on the fly because the training data is (like a true on-line policy method) totally dependent on the samples genrated from the agent interacting with the environment. This GRPO method is a HUGE advantage since I no longer have to underscore the advantage calculation by learning a second network, and deal with the reward directly.",1
post31tec,technical,0.6642971305541576,lowest,"According to the paper, they are not using a neural network to calculate the reward. It looks like they have a series of reward functions that assign reward based on accuracy and formatting. I believe they use different reward functions for different datasets as well, for example, using a sandboxed environment to run tests on generated code samples. 

  
From the paper:

>2.2.2. Reward Modeling   
  
The reward is the source of the training signal, which decides the optimization direction of RL. To train DeepSeek-R1-Zero, we adopt a rule-based reward system that mainly consists of two types of rewards:  
  
\- **Accuracy rewards**: The accuracy reward model evaluates whether the response is correct. For example, in the case of math problems with deterministic results, the model is required to provide the final answer in a specified format (e.g., within a box), enabling reliable rule-based verification of correctness. Similarly, for LeetCode problems, a compiler can be used to generate feedback based on predefined test cases.  
  
\- **Format rewards**: In addition to the accuracy reward model, we employ a format reward model that enforces the model to put its thinking process between ‘’ and ‘’ tags.   
  
We do not apply the outcome or process neural reward model in developing DeepSeek-R1-Zero, because we find that the neural reward model may suffer from reward hacking in the large-scale reinforcement learning process, and retraining the reward model needs additional training resources and it complicates the whole training pipeline.

  
GRPO is just another method for updating a model relative to some reward function. It does not stipulate what that reward function is. So, in many cases, people use GRPO with a neural network reward model. In the case of R1, the ""reward model"" appears to just be a series of reward functions.

It might help to look at HuggingFace's docs for their GRPO trainer to get a sense of how that might look: [https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/grpo\_trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/grpo_trainer)",1

post31tec,technical,0.6642971305541576,lowest,"Yes, neural networks can be used for group evaluations, depending on the context and goal of the evaluation. Let me break this down for you:

Neural Networks in Group Evaluation

A neural network can process and evaluate group performance or dynamics by analyzing various data inputs. Here’s how this might work:

1. Data Input:

Individual contributions (e.g., work quality, engagement, etc.).

Group-level metrics (e.g., collaboration efficiency, task completion time).

Behavioral or social interaction data (e.g., communication patterns, decision-making dynamics).



2. Feature Extraction: The neural network extracts patterns and features from the data, such as:

How well group members complement each other’s skills.

Consistency and efficiency of collaboration.

Sentiment or tone in group communication.



3. Training the Model: If using supervised learning, the network is trained on historical data with labeled outcomes (e.g., ""successful group"" vs. ""unsuccessful group""). It learns to associate input patterns with specific outcomes.


4. Evaluation: The trained neural network evaluates unseen group data and predicts outcomes, such as:

Overall group success or productivity.

Likelihood of achieving specific goals.

Recommendations for improvement (e.g., better skill allocation).




Practical Application Examples

Team Productivity Assessment: Companies can use neural networks to evaluate team performance based on project data, timelines, and collaboration quality.

Educational Group Projects: Neural networks can assess student group performance by analyzing participation levels, contribution balance, and project results.

Sports Teams: Analyzing player performance metrics to optimize team dynamics and predict game outcomes.


How This Works in Practice

In practice, a neural network works by:

1. Receiving input features about individuals and group interactions.


2. Using hidden layers to process and identify patterns in these features.


3. Outputting an evaluation score, classification (e.g., ""effective/ineffective""), or actionable insights for improving group performance.



Challenges

Data availability: Requires detailed and accurate input data.

Bias: Neural networks might reflect biases present in the training data.

Interpretability: Understanding the ""why"" behind the predictions can be tricky.",1

post7tec,technical,0.687801003229816,lowest,"> What about these fixed the repetition issues? 

Models learning to consider more context.

Basic language prediction is can be done with a very, very short context. Based on the past one or two words, you can often predict the next word decently well. So if we have a model that basically only looks at the past 2 words, and we take the most probable next word, it's very easy to get stuck in a loop. Ngrams and RNNs do this very easily. Transformers are the first architecture that have a strong enough signal from far enough back to have the ability to overcome this. 

That the model has that ability, doesn't mean it always learns to carefully look at the context. The previous few words are still by far the strongest predictor of the next word. So even a Transformer needs to look at the previous few words first, before it could start to consider the whole context.

Anyways, this is my human interpretation of how and why this works this way. ""Looking"", ""first"", and ""consider"" are kinda undefined terms for a neural network.",3
post7tec,technical,0.687801003229816,lowest,"But how come the earlier models learned to look at only a few previous words? The optimization process, the training data both should encourage the model to consider the whole context and predict a token that syntactically and semantically makes sense.

Recall that the alibi is designed to add a scaled relative position bias to the attention scores before softmax. As the sequence length grows, the alibi score bias added to the attention score will be very large.

Alibi is more like putting a sliding window along the sequence, however, the window size is really small as the sequence grows long. This will definitely harm the performance of LLM on a certain downstream task.

&#x200B;

For example, you want to do information extraction with BLOOM. The max input sequence length is 1024. Our prompt and context are very long, let's say, 800 tokens, Our question starts from 801, and the answer is at the beginning of the context, say 10, Can the 801th token see the 10th token with Alibi?

I think BLOOM can hardly see it because of Alibi. Since the relative bias between question and answer is

(801 - 10 ) \* m = 791 \* m, m is a scale factor.

The huge bias will lead to an attention score A\_{801, 10} close to 0, which means that question tokens can only see nearby tokens and ignore answer tokens.",1
post20tec,technical,0.70048835683848,lowest,"I think your points are two folds:
1. ALibi is a variant of window attention, so its receptive field is restricted.
2. The window is small that it cannot perform good performance on long context.

For 1, I think for any relative positional encoding method, remote attenuation is needed (it's intuitive to pay more attention on more recent tokens), so one of the differences between alibi and rope is the scale of window. The authors of RoPE mentioned in the paper that the upper bound of RoPE is decreasing when the distance between two tokens is increasing,  too.

For 2, the theoretical receptive field of alibi is actually  wr, where w is the window size, r is the number of layers for a model. So if the window size is 256, theoretically a model using alibi as its positional encoding with 4 layers can see both the question and the answer in your case.

The running model knows nothing about the grammar you have loaded.

It doesn't affect the model otherwise. The model does not ""know"" there is a grammar, it does not use context, there is no prompt.

BTW: be careful with the grammar: if it is too restrictive, it will force the model to sample very low probability tokens and it will start to operate in ""out of distribution"" and it will break down.

post44tec,technical,0.7026461906081227,lowest,"This is a very rough analogy, but you can think of it like this:

When the model is predicting the next token, it's a little like taking a bag of scrabble tiles, ranking them based on how likely they are, and randomly picking one based on the weighting.

A grammar is a set of rules that defines what the output should look like; you can think of it like a regex pattern. (Only more powerful, since BNF defines a context-free grammar, which is type 2 and regular expressions are type 3.) For any given string, you can compare and see if it matches the rules laid out by the grammar. 

When the LLM sampler uses the grammar, it discards all of the scrabble tiles that don't match the patterns described by the rules. Then it picks from the remaining tiles.

Some fine-tuned models expect to sometimes output javascript, while others do not. If you've got one where Javascript is unlikely, then it's not going to put very high weighting on valid javascript syntax. After `{` you'd expect to see either ` ""` or `}` or maybe `\n`. If it doesn't assign a high weight to ` ""` then it'll have a high chance of closing off the whole thing with `}` and stopping. Or even just outputting the end-of-sequence token instead of `{`.

You can help it a bit for explicitly asking for JSON (which hopefully increases the weighting of the JSON tokens) or pre-priming the response to start with `{ ""` just to get it started. But if it's never seen JSON used as a response before, it's going to have a hard time either way.",3

To answer your original question:   
LLAMA.CPP models a nondeterministic pushdown automaton (NPDA) with N stacks to maintain possible parse states. You can see the original [PR](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/1773) with some important comments there. They decided to implement their own simplified grammar syntax called GBNF and a simulation algorithm that updates the state of the NPDA. This method works reasonably well on smaller grammars that have been tested like JSON. But it is unlikely to scale to larger grammars. This is mainly because using an NPDA as a parser is computationally expensive for large grammars. Typically, compilers use parsers like LL(k) or LR(k), which are fast simulators of PDAs and support a major subset of context-free grammars that we generally care about.",1

I think the main problem with sinusoidal embeddings is that the model 'remembers' specific position embeddings and associates certain things with them, and doesn't really understand the 'concept' that the sinusoidal embeddings are trying to encode.

By totally removing the position embeddings from the model, we block the model's ability to do this. But we still need to feed the model positional information, and so we find a much better way to do this, by just changing attention scores based on distance.

post16tec,technical,0.7389787976692476,lowest,">Couldn’t we just use a distance threshold instead of top k to dynamically retrieve documents

This is unlikely to change anything in the LLM token cost question. Vector index retrievals are fast and inexpensive compared to LLM use. In the RAG setup, the usefulness of the vector metric is first of all in that it allows to sort (rank) documents by relevance (from the closest to the furthest, with some cutoff), and to pass them to the LLM, in this order. Then, cutting off by vector metric value rather than fixed k is unlikely to help in any practical scenario, and is usually worse than fixed k.

>My main issue with self rag and this is that it incurs extra llm calls which is what drives cost and inference time

Actually, LLM API's like OpenAI don't charge per call, they charge per token used - and this is consistent with their computational effort. The presented approach saves tokens - it uses several calls with fewer tokens \*in total\*, rather than one call that costs a lot of tokens. While network/API latency may sometimes be a factor when calculating latencies, overall, the described approach should also have lower total inference time.

post16tec,technical,0.7389787976692476,lowest,">This approach would reduce accuracy on questions that require the combined knowledge of several documents.

True! - this limitation on the type of supported questions is (hopefully) discussed in the text. Workarounds are potentially interesting. One partial one could be to start the adaptive k-value not from 2 but from a larger constant (like 4 or 5). Another partial one could be allow the LLM to answer according to a template, signifying that it has found a partial answer but would be likely to need more context - it often knows this if one document e.g. references another that seems to be missing. 

>It is problematic to use this approach in situations where the response is streamed to reduce time to the first visible token.

Actually, the problem exists already in any top-k RAG approach. If the answer is in the n-th chunk in the prompt, the LLM cannot start streaming output before getting to this chunk. In this approach the delay may indeed be aggravated, but by a factor of 2x at most if you are really unlucky (more like 1.4x on average depending on answer distributions in chunks); this can be reduced further by tuning geometric series parameters. By contrast, if for a given problem the LLM is unable to stream first outputs before reading all inputs, the delay is actually reduced.",2
post16tec,technical,0.7389787976692476,lowest,"This is an interesting take on a 3-way tradeoff: accuracy (precision/recall), token cost, latency. This prioritizes token cost and precision at the expense of latency. 

Another approach is to retrieve top k chunks via various methods (e.g. semantic via vecdb, lexical via keyword/bm25, fuzzy search, etc), then apply **relevance extraction:** use k async/concurrent calls to the LLM to identify **relevant extracts** from each of these, and feed those into the context for the LLM compose a final answer. During relevance extraction, all k chunks will be ""seen"" by the LLM (hence we don't save on *input* token cost), but you can avoid a large *output* token cost by *numbering* your sentences or segments and simply asking the LLM to identify the relevant segment numbers. This approach addresses the issue of confusion due to too many irrelevant chunks (hence achieves good precision, as well as good recall if k is sufficiently large), but latency stays low due to the async relevance extraction.

We use this approach in Langroid's [DocChatAgent](https://github.com/langroid/langroid/blob/main/langroid/agent/special/doc_chat_agent.py), which uses a separate RelevanceExtractorAgent to do the async/concurrent relevance extraction.

post1tec,technical,0.7897877842641812,lowest,"Matrices multiplication Q.KT is defined by dot product of row of Q and col of KT, which is row of K. Dot product gives the similarities between 2 vectors (remember cosine similarities, but we now also care about the vectors' magnitudes), the higher number is the higher the importance of the Key wrt to the Query.

So now you might ask, what if the vectors have high magnitudes, that's where we have those LayerNorm to force them back to L2-Norm=1. Tbh I'd want to see what if we use LayerNorm right before first attention layer, bc the Linear layer for the first attention actually do a lot of normalization and projection.

In self attention, Q=K so what you have is the importance of each token to other tokens in the sentence. Note, there is a linear layer that acts as projections of Q and K to different spaces and that's the part that actually learns the language model",1

Think of a dictionary in programming (dictionary=associative array).

Regular ones are static with a 1:1 mapping between keys and values.

When we need a dictionary that is more flexible, i.e. one that is differentiable, as a component in a transformer or maybe elsewhere, we can implement this **differentiable dictionary** using the **mechanism of self-attention**.

Each self-attention mechanism can represent different contextual relationships among a set of elements, by comparing the set to itself (as in dot product itself), scaling, soft-maxing the result and using that to represent the amount of weighting to assign to each value. So the weighting is based on self-referential context.

This mechanism acts as a type of **smoothing kernel**.

We combine a whole bunch of these self-attention mechanisms with some other components (like residual connections, normalizers, and mlps) and we get a transformer.

The ability to have different self-attention mechanisms focusing on different contexts all at once and then combining those attentions in myriad ways is what helps to make transformers so powerful.

Particularly when carried out with **massive compute and data**.",1
post1tec,technical,0.7897877842641812,lowest,"so each attention head tunes itself in a way to calculate just one kind of contextual similarity between each token? and then we somehow combine multiple attention heads to give us a whole bunch of contextual information between all the tokens in the vocabulary?

is that what you're implying?",2
post1tec,technical,0.7897877842641812,lowest,">I don't quite understand why this multiplication gives us a meaningful metric for importance.

Because of gradient descent. The model is trained to find query and key values such that this multiplication will give a meaningful metric for importance. There is literally no other constraint on the key and query vectors, they're not used for anything else, so gradient descent is free to ""choose"" whatever vectors work best

As for why it's possible to use inner product as a measure of importance, imagine each entry in the key vector as an attribute, like ""implies a location"" or ""usually a noun"" or ""signals a casual tone,"" etc. The key vector is a list of how much the token has each attribute. The query vector is a list of how useful each attribute would be to know. Obviously we don't know in general what the attributes are or how they're represented, but the point is you can represent attributes with a vector and then find the total relevance with an inner product.",1
post1tec,technical,0.7897877842641812,lowest,"Thanks. This helped in kind of visualizing the importance/significance of key and query vectors.

What would you say the value vector is for in the same sense? We take the dot product between key and query, divide by root of key dimensionality and apply softmax which gives a normalized representation of how important each token is to each token (total\_tokens, embedding\_dim). (is this correct btw?)

Then we, for some reason pass this through another linear layer(value layer). Why do we do this?",2
post1tec,technical,0.7897877842641812,lowest,"The square-root-of-dimension thing is just for training purposes, it improves computational stability but doesn't really change things because the vectors can just get bigger/smaller to compensate

Think of the value vector as a way of perturbing the representation of your vector. The tokens are represented by vectors in the embedding space. The value vector is added to that embedding vector, changing it slightly, yielding a new point in latent space. 

The softmax roughly means ""choose the best one,"" in this case the single context token which best matches the query, and add only that token's value to the original embedding. Except literally choosing just one wouldn't be differentiable so we use softmax (instead of max) to hedge our bets. If two tokens are equally good, we split the difference and hope it works. If one token is twice as good as another, we do 2/3 of that one and 1/3 of the other. Etc.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""pass through another linear layer."" Are you referring to multi-headed attention?

A linear layer (no activation) is just rotation in latent space. It doesn't do anything at all in terms of adding information, it just relabels the information. Maybe to get it ready for some nonlinear operation that needs a specific labeling, or because it was being stored in a lower dimension and couldn't get properly labeled when it was created

In the case of multi-headed attention, since each head outputs a vector much smaller (in dimension) than the embedding space, the linear layer is just a list of what embedding vector each head's outputs correspond to

Answer: Run it on N units of compute. Congratulations! It's constant time now. 

In geometry/geography queries, an R-tree index where higher nodes in the tree represent the bounding box of all children allow you to query the geometries in sub linear time. You have to reformulate nearest neighbors queries into ""within a respectable distance of the point"" to use the index, though. 

Those are great for 2D, weaker for 3D, and the curse of dimensionality starts making 4D rough in terms of:

a. the memory required
b. the difficulty of picking a distance/volume from your query point to narrow the nearest neighbors search 

Approximate nearest neighbors techniques like hnsw relax the constraints to build indices that allow sub linear queries without the challenges of a high dimensional R-tree index. 

All that to say: yes, you can do it in sub linear time if you have infinite compute. Otherwise, you are trying to solve a novel problem in computer science and you're not the first to try. As an exercise to see how hard this is, grab an R-tree index python library and start building n-dimensional trees starting with n=2.",1

post40tec,technical,0.8067337839578385,lowest,"I had two concerns that I was hoping you could clarify:

#### Preserving Embedding Boundaries

- Since MASS slides a window across the concatenated sequence, wouldn’t this cause misalignment issues, where query embeddings (length 128) overlap partial embeddings in the concatenated sequence?
- Would enforcing a fixed step size of 128 (to ensure queries align with full embeddings) negate the efficiency gains of MASS

#### Time Complexity Compared to Brute Force and ANN

- While MASS accelerates Euclidean distance computation via FFT, doesn’t the requirement to scan all valid starting positions make it at least O(n) (assuming step size = 128)?
- Given that ANN methods like FAISS and HNSW achieve sub-linear search time via indexing, would MASS still offer an efficiency advantage in practice?",2
post40tec,technical,0.8067337839578385,lowest,"For the first point, you can just take the minimum value in the distance profile, that is a multiple of 128



For the second point...

Yes, there is a trade off. You may be able to get faster with an index, but...

1) An index takes time to build, MASS takes zero time.

2) An index takes memory overheard, MASS takes very little memory

3) MASS supports arbitrary weighed euclidean distance queries.

4) MASS can exploit GPUs with almost zero effort

5) MASS queries take exactly predicable time, in contrast almost all indexes have good cases and bad cases based on the query. So with the worse case query, they can be unpredictably slow.

6) MASS is exact, but if you want a faster approx version, you can do that with one line of code (slide 15 of \[a\])

I am not saying that MASS is the best or only solution, but for the amount of effort needed (five minutes) the quality of solution is very good

\- Is the LLM trained to generate structured output (JSON). Keep in mind not all LLMs are good at it. Check the model card/documentation for your LLM to figure out if its good at structured responses.

\- Assuming your model is good at structured response generation : pay attention to your prompt, make sure you are provide the schema in valid format. In addition, depending on the model you may need to provide few shots.

\- Assuming your prompt is good - use a framework like LangChain and Pydantic to address any schema issues

Here is a sample that shows the use of Pydantic:

- if you can, use structured output with schemas from OpenAI

- this will cover 90% of parsing fails, to cover another 9.9% you can implement a small mechanism to resend to the LLM its latest response, tell it the error and to try and fix it, possible multiple rounds of that 
- try to simplify the schema you need if possible
- upgrade to a smarter model. 
- use temperature 0.0
- besides the schema, put real output examples for it in the prompt

I believe that in the long run someone will come up with a better way of dynamically encoding and retrieving memories in an LLM. The memories will not be stored in plaintext like with rag, but will instead be highly compressed embeddings of some sort, or maybe even small sub-networks.",1
post2tec,technical,0.8589096187065063,lowest,"I don't doubt that you can come up with something smarter than what we already have, but to store more information without forgetting something you learned previously, we need to either increase the compression ratio, which becomes infeasible at some point or increase the ""storage"" space. In a way, longer context follows the second route, but you end up with quadratic growth (at least with standard attention) and it becomes harder to find what you're looking for in all that data.

post2tec,technical,0.8589096187065063,lowest,"The thing about both longer context and rag is that they both need to store the original text uncompressed. With longer context there is also the quadratic scaling problem you mention, and with ordinary RAG the retrieval mechanism isn’t dynamically tuned.

Somehow the human brain is capable of storing new memories dynamically and also holding onto these memories indefinitely. There is obviously some kind of compression going on along with a system for determining when memories should be created and retrieved.

With LLMs I could see it going a couple of different ways. Maybe like a more dynamic form of MoE where new experts can be dynamically created without impacting existing experts. It could also be more like RAG, but instead of storing the raw text, the model learns to store and retrieve some kind of compressed embedding. There could also be some system for “forgetting” stale information that seems to be of low value.",3

Nearly all the solutions for the bigger projects (projects that offer some form of distributed compute and usually a paid service) are doing the exact same thing under the hood and relying on the same algorithm/algorithm combos to do the index building and searching.

post37tec,technical,0.9447508249322008,lowest,"For this I would recommend using OpenSearch with FAISS and IVFPQ (Product Quantization) as the algorithm.  PQ works with codebooks and compresses the index, and there is no graph that is changing as you update individual documents/vectors - it's a flat index with ANN lookups based on clustering.

The downsides of PQ:

 * With PQ you will lose some recall (3%-5%), which you can mitigate with a two-pass rerank with oversampling and full precision calculation.
 * The codebooks need to be calculated offline, so you need to do a calculation up-front before loading all your documents/vectors, and as content drifts you should recalculate at some frequency (every month or so is common)

The upsides are very good:

 * Updates without any issue, and OpenSearch/FAISS will handle this very well.
 * You actually compress the index, and it requires about 1/10th RAM.
 * It's very fast, and even with oversampling and rerank you'll hit latency targets easily",1

Further, I think that my plan to tax businesses based upon replacement of workers with AI will actually lead to an *increased* rate of development, because if we base an annual tax upon the prior year's employee cost plus a small percentage (1-5%) to secure against inflation and future growth (perhaps subtracting the cost of the AI units?), then they could buy 2-3 times as many AI units and produce significantly more products at a lower cost. This drastically increases their profits, such that they are more than overperforming by the end of the year, and the tax is a drop in the pond. 

This provides a strong incentive for businesses to encourage AI development, reduces the incentive for people to discourage its development (as the economic issues disappear), and creates a system that *supports* the adaptation of AI by businesses.

ETA: It's also the only way that I see those businesses continuing to be able to grow, like they want to: as more people become unemployed, they won't have enough customers to support any growth.

Annual tax for *businesses* calculated by the current year's employment cost burden, minus the prior year's employment cost burden, minus the cost any purchased AI units, plus 3-5% of reported revenue to secure against future growth and inflation.

Begin with a rate of $40,000 per year to those who are shown to have been laid off due to being replaced with AI, or who can otherwise show that their unemployment is a direct effect of AI adoption by businesses. As this grows, AI takes more jobs, and more people enter the system, it transitions into a proper UBI where everyone gets a set amount that would be roughly equivalent to the median wage (currently $42,000).

This smooth transition would also allow us to be more precise about what exact values would work best once we reach proper UBI, and would reduce feelings of resentment towards those receiving it in the interrem, because their trade--their means of putting food on the table for their family--was directly taken away from them and others can start to see AI coming for their own. I think people would support that, behind the right candidate.

The reason why people care about using bi-encoders for reranking is because they are much smaller, faster, and cheaper than using decoder-based language models. That allows the end user to rerank a larger number of results before passing them to the decoder model.

However, if you were able to achieve these results using only bi-encoders and other models with << 1b parameters then that’s a great feat and I’d be super interested in reading a blog post or paper about how you achieved the results!",1
post41tec,technical,1.003489327528527,lowest,"While bi-encoders are efficient, they don't generalize that well. I would love a world where they also generalize well.  
  
Fine-tuning medium sized LLMs to be rerankers works and is more accurate and significantly more efficient than prompting GPT-4. There are multiple formulations of this though:  
\- Pointwise: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08319](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08319)  
\- Setwise: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09497](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09497)

post41tec,technical,1.003489327528527,lowest,"I don’t think prompting GPT-4 is a good comparison point because that is a massive model (1.2t parameters) and isn’t even a SOTA model and hasn’t been for a while.

I think a better comparison is prompting the 5-10b parameter models like gpt-4o-mini or Llama 3.1 8b models. The pointwise paper you sent was a fine tune of a 7b parameter Llama model. And if you already knew about the papers, then why did you think your solution was the first of its kind?

And again, even beyond those papers, using decoder-based LLMs to rerank results has been around for years (and I know of a couple of companies that even have it as part of their API offerings). 

In the article on your site, you are comparing reranking results to Voyage and Cohere. But their reranker models are in the 300-700m parameter range. Assuming your solution is something similar to pointwise and you are using a fine-tuned 5-10b parameter LLM, I don’t think it’s helpful to only compare it to much smaller cross-encoder models. Cross-encoders are used for the reranking purpose because they are fast and cheap, allowing for reranking a larger set of results without costing much latency before passing to an LLM.

At my company we host a bge-m3 reranker model (568m params) and our reranking is sub 50 ms and it is pretty cheap to run compared to something like the Llama models.

So in curious how this reranking method compares to something like pointwise or even just raw prompting of 4o-mini or Llama 3.1 8b.

We are not comparing to Cohere and Voyage's smaller bi-encoder embedding models. We are comparing to their cross-encoder rerankers with similar latency and pricing.

post22tec,technical,1.0186055226746091,lowest,"For dev/synthetic data I've been swapping back and forth between vLLM and SGLang over the past few months. I think it's very fluid and hard to say which is really best, especially for bigger models (mostly using 70B+ models which require at least tp=4 up to tp=16 (2xH100 nodes) for DeepSeek-V3/R1). It's great to have multiple strong options.

* When DeepSeek-V3 first came out SGLang was much faster than vLLM, but they are now neck and neck. Both are racing on features/improvements from multiple contributors for faster implementations (DeepGEMM, MLA, etc). Both are not 100% stable btw and a bit crashy, especially at high concurrency
* vLLM is currently transitioning to the V1 engine (doesn't work for everything and sometimes is slower). I think in the long term this is going to be a big improvement. In a lot of ways vLLM has been carrying a fair amount of technical debt, and a lot of settings required for tuning perf.
* A lot of labs have standardized on vLLM/work with so you get Day 1 support for Mistral, Gemma 3 models  for example. I'd recommend having envs w/ both SGLang and vLLM (stable and nightlies) to be able to swap off as necessary
* This is especially worth doing as some builds may not be happy w/ your config. On p5d SageMaker nodes (Ubuntu 20.04.6, Linux 5.15.0-1072-aws, Nvidia driver 550.127.05) even with CUDA 12.6 in the env (which addresses some NCCL errors), vLLM is crashier than SGLang - I think one thing often overlooked is actualy just how often specific versions of your kernel, drivers, libs, and system setup will affect benchmarks - vLLM and SGLang are largely a combination of python glue code and GPU kernels, there's a lot that's outside their control and a lot of results are going to vary, so it's best to test for your own setup
* While vLLM has more mature speculative decoding, SGLang just launched EAGLE2/EAGLE3 sd - this is super fast, but requires additional training to get EAGLE draft models - if you're optimizing a production workload it will probably be worth it tough - the EAGLE team reported 400 TPS for a Llama 3.1 8B model on a single H100, that's bonkers: [https://x.com/hongyangzh/status/1903109123895341536](https://x.com/hongyangzh/status/1903109123895341536)
* For multinode, I much prefer SGLang's simple setup vs Ray - the docs for vLLM are *barely* adequate for setting up Ray w/ slurm. I would probably have burnt days on this without the help of Claude and o1-Pro and even then, it's just ugly.
* On a single GPU on older gen GPUs (A10G, 3090 equivalent) running a single smallish model I did extensive testing and found w/ the Marlin kernels that vLLM was slightly faster on throughput, but SGLang had a much better P99 TTFT - Doing tests w/ FP16, FP8, and a bunch of quant formats I found W8A8 to be optimal for my use case btw (best scaling for concurrency, lowest TTFT and decent throughput all at \*better\* than FP16 downstream perf due to an optimized calibration set). I feel like at the end of the day, any shootoff will be ""it depends"" rather than a A or B is better.
* Last year I was doing a lot of perf comparison/tunings w/ vLLM: [https://shisa.ai/posts/tuning-vllm-mi300x/](https://shisa.ai/posts/tuning-vllm-mi300x/) \- I found that changing configurations could often result in 2-3X differences in perf numbers and I felt like I was largely still just scratching the surface. For anyone doing production deployments, I'd highly recommend that people deep dive into the various writeups and tuning guides available.

* Understand the U.S. system for presidential elections.
* Do not use polling data.
* Use and analyze actual events.

The model utilizes **Google Trends (a great starting point to identify an initial event)** to identify when candidates receive more online attention. At that point, it is prompted to investigate why this attention occurs. The question ""but why?"" is asked repeatedly until a topic is broken down to its core. Then, it is evaluated against the values of various social groups that can vote and how it might influence their opinions. Since the media in the U.S. can be biased (e.g., Fox = Republican, CNN = Democratic), the model avoids relying on news articles. If it must use an article from a U.S. news source (or any worldwide source), the article is broken down into an abstract event, removing the human element of the reporter.

While the article is fact-checked, the model also assesses how fact-checking influences voter perceptions. For example, if a candidate were to say, ""I'm Tom Cruise,"" which is obviously false, the model checks whether people actually believe this statement. The model is designed to distinguish between sarcasm and honest beliefs in conspiracy theories, and this is taken into account.

As you suggest, this is an important point, and the model should be adjusted to eliminate this possibility. Currently, it is not very random, but it could and should be more precise. I asked the model how it would be able to make a calculated prediction for an election in a fictional country resembling the U.S. It identified what data would be important to know, and, of course, ""polling data"" was one of the suggestions. I then asked it to propose an alternative way to make predictions based on daily events. This model requires significant refinement, and your feedback has made me acutely aware of this.

**Would it be beneficial to include vice presidential candidates in the equation as well? I**'m uncertain about the impact their rallies and speeches have on the presidential election. I believe this is a unique election cycle, and the influence of vice presidential candidates in the past may differ significantly from the situation in 2024.

At this point, the model is not comparing the personalities of Harris and Trump. I might consider adding this comparison, but I'm unsure if it really matters since everyone is already familiar with Trump's style, as historical data demonstrates. Harris is more difficult to analyze because most people base their opinions on her campaign statements. For a test run, I may incorporate their personalities (as far as they can be identified) into the model, but I believe it will not significantly impact the Electoral College.

I think for a VP to matter it would have to be a very specific combination.  Like Kennedy/Johnson.   where the candidate would fill a potential gap in the Electoral College map.   I don't think either VP contender does that.  I would just say in this cycle the dominant factor will will be the predictor.   the rest is noise.",3
post42con,controversial,1.0289790545619748,lowest,"That is the essence of the experiment: ""Is it possible?"" (Yes/No) and, if it is possible, ""How accurate can it be?"" The more relevant data we gather, the better, and you just provided a wealth of information that deserves serious consideration. If the combination regarding the vice president is part of the formula, then the model can evaluate this and take it into account while also considering the current zeitgeist.

I plan to repost new data every few days, with a final prediction the day before the elections. This Reddit post has revealed many variables that may or may not matter. All of these suggestions will be incorporated into the model. Whenever the model determines that a variable or event is not important, it must explain why.

I was surprised that the assassination attempt(s) on Trump’s life were not considered significant events; the model concluded they would not change the outcome unless the attempt was successful. It reasoned that this was merely a security issue. One of Trump's key talking points has always been ""security,"" so the fact that someone tried to kill him doesn't alter much since he has already promised to reduce crime. Being the victim of a crime himself is, therefore, abstractly irrelevant.

If he had claimed, ""Crime does not exist in the U.S. compared to four years ago,"" and then experienced an assassination attempt, the model might have viewed it as an event worth analyzing. 

It’s often hard to understand how that in the end, we don't really know how AI model works because it operates like a ""black box."" This means we can see what goes in and what comes out, but we can't easily see what happens inside. AI models, especially complex ones, use many layers of calculations that transform the input into an output in ways that are not straightforward. Additionally, the AI learns from examples, so the data it was trained on greatly influences how it behaves. Even tools that try to explain the AI's decisions only provide partial insights, making it challenging to fully grasp its inner workings. In essence, while I can ask the model to explain some the decisions it makes (specifically) I have limited influence on how and why it gets to a specific result. What I can ""program"" is what to take into consideration, what it absolutely must do and what is may not do. Whatever magic happens inside is invisible for me (also for the companies that build this models). 

I believe that total abstraction—such as ignoring the influence of vice presidential combinations—is not the best approach. I've received valuable input from Reddit users to enhance the model's performance. Even if the final result remains the same (since variables applied to both candidates might cancel each other out), it's still crucial to provide the model with as much unbiased, factual data as possible. This way, it can consider all relevant information in its analysis.

I don’t believe that adding 2,000 or even 20,000 data points will make a significant difference. For instance, the fact that Harris likes Doritos and Trump prefers McDonald's seems irrelevant. I plan to wait a few days to see if other users provide more valuable input. I will post an update that includes a link to a more extensive document, which can be verified. This document will contain a precise explanation of the calculations, detailing the variables the model uses and how each data point impacts the results, including the degree of that impact.

""This process utilizes reinforcement learning, enabling the model to eliminate bias from the information it processes. For instance, if a fan event occurs and is covered by a news outlet like Fox, the model disregards the source's perspective and focuses solely on extracting the event details and topic in the most abstract form. The model can rewrite any data point or source as if it were published by AI, devoid of bias.

You can test this yourself by feeding any article to GPT and asking it to rewrite the article as abstractly as possible. Instruct the GPT to believe it is communicating with another GPT, aiming to convey the information in the most logical, clear, and efficient manner possible, as if sharing data in a world where humans no longer exist. In this scenario, GPT becomes purely data-driven, devoid of emotion or bias. Once the information is abstracted, the model is tasked with statistically evaluating the societal impact of the data, comparing it data souces across regions like South America, Central America, Europe, africa and Asia. The process is repeated for these data sources. The abstract average is used as datapoint.  The following techniques are used in order to eliminate as much bias as possible

 This this experiment will test how raw data is influenced by human emotion. 


Truthfully, this experiment should provoke thought. If successful, and the model accurately predicts state-level outcomes with over 90% accuracy, I would find it unsettling.",2
post42con,controversial,1.0289790545619748,lowest,"Ok, so by ""unbiased"" you mean that you're attempting to de-bias sources.  
  
I had thought you were claiming that it's a statistically unbiased estimator, but that would take a lot of testing of predictions against actual outcomes to demonstrate.",3
post42con,controversial,1.0289790545619748,lowest,"While I am currently the initial actor feeding data (with GPT selecting certain points), I still retain control to accept or reject that data. However, this should evolve. In future versions, it would make more sense for the process to become a project between two GPTs, where they collaborate to refine themselves based on their outputs. The human role should be minimized to something as simple as seeding the model with a query like ""predict election x,"" leaving the GPTs to create and refine a model that accomplishes the task.

While AI can make predictions about the future based on established scientific principles—such as physics, or how we likely won’t have US elections once the sun runs out of energy—those calculations are based on fixed, known data. Predicting elections, on the other hand, falls under the realm of social science, which is far more complex. Currently, models rely heavily on polling data and biased online information, especially when using media sources in polarized environments like the US. As a result, they often provide predictions no different from what you'd see on a news broadcast or read in a newspaper. The alternative is even more problematic—models begin to hallucinate.

For instance, when I requested certain data points, the GPT returned not only the correct dates but also projected events well beyond the requested timeframe. When I questioned why, it responded by saying its data points included actual, hypothetical, and likely events. While superintelligence might eventually be able to offer divine-like insights into the future, for now, we must ensure the model operates within clear boundaries.

The model I am building must verify its logic, cross-check the data it uses, and allow me to flag incorrect information. For example, if it generated a false claim like “Harris and Trump married on 2024-10-22,” I would need to correct that and ask it to explain why it added that data point. It should only use publicly available, factual information that could realistically impact the outcome of a prediction. Fictional data, self-generated content, or anything not verified as real should be excluded. The model should also conduct its own form of self-peer review to ensure data isn't derived from memes, sarcasm, or comedic sources. Without this, the model might take something said by a late-night host as factual without critical examination.

post42con,controversial,1.0289790545619748,lowest,"This is an early alpha version, far from being a beta, even though elections are just two weeks away. There’s still much room for refinement, and future elections worldwide will provide opportunities to further test and improve the model. The goal is to make it capable of predicting outcomes in ""democratic"" elections, though it will need to account for variables related to external influences or internal stakeholders that can impact the results.

Elections in my country are vastly different from those in places like the US. My country, for example, has one of the most complex and extreme political systems in the Western world. While it may seem nearly impossible to manage, it somehow functions. Some Western countries perform better, others less efficiently, but all things considered, we're doing pretty well given the circumstances.

**We have**

* **Federal elections**: Around **15-18 parties**.
* **Regional elections**:
   * **Region a**: **6-8 parties**.
   * **Region b**: **5-6 parties**.
   * **Region c:** **10-12 parties**.
   * **Region d**: **2-3 parties**.
* **European elections**: Around **13-17 parties** (depending on linguistic regions).

General rules in my country:

In my country, coalition governments are the standard due to the proportional representation system, where no single party typically secures a majority. To form a coalition, several important steps must be followed:

**Majority rule:** The coalition must hold over 50% of the seats in parliament to govern effectively.

**Linguistic balance**: At the federal level, both major language groups their parties must be included to ensure representation of the different linguistic communities.

**Policy agreement**: Parties must reach a consensus on a shared policy plan before finalizing the coalition, often requiring compromise.

**Balanced cabinet**: There must be an equal number of regional ministers in the federal cabinet, aside from the prime minister.

**Vote of confidence:** The coalition must win a vote of confidence in parliament to officially take power.

Sometimes we have re-elections, most of the time after elections it takes about a year to form a government (up until then, the former government runs things but has limited power, like running windows on safe mode).

So there are a lot of ways to have democratic elections, the model should not be limited (over mid-long term to US elections only). The only election outcome beside the scope of the models capabilities should be dictatorships, countries in conflict (war), etc...

**Given how rapidly technology is evolving, it's hard to predict the possibilities for models like this even four years from now. Just four years ago, language models weren’t a major topic of discussion. Back then, AI was primarily recognized for achievements like winning games (chess, Go) and scientific applications such as protein folding. It hadn’t yet become a widely available consumer service.** I try to export the data that drives the model, the abstract logic, etc to several data file formats like json, xml, etc in order to be able to import is into future versions of any AI language model. This is a begin and honestly I would be very surprised it would really me very precise on the first try. The only thing I can to is try to understand how the model tries to predict results and when I see a logical error I ask the model to ""debug"" itself and self correct. I believe that models like these only evolve when they ""understand"" ("""" because I have no idea how they understand stuff in internal processing) problems and are able to discover their mistakes and update their reasoning. Simple example, is a model says 2 + 2 = 5 (one of for example 10000 calculations) I need it to identify this one as wrong, explain to me why it is wrong or how this error could slip into the results and correct it.
