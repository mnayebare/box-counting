Shareholders of said companies (who are almost always short-sighted) love layoffs.  \n\nWhile I think AI will make many wealthy people more wealthy, I'm not so sure it will replace much of the jobs that AI leadership claims it will.  \n\nI do believe AI in social media as well as the extreme echo chambers that began as curated content to be hugely problematic for society.\n\nThe consolidated media industry is probably something greater to worry about.",

How is he factoring his operational cost? Does he include the training cost of the models just released, a value that is high now but gets lower every day etc. Where is the majority of the costs coming from, audio, video etc. \n\n^ you see where I'm going with this, Sam is a bullshit artist and can't be trusted.",

[https://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf](https://thenewobjectivity.com/pdf/marx.pdf) Because I like to be funny I used automation to write this summary.\n\n>Marx argues that machinery creates a fundamental contradiction for capitalism because it simultaneously tries to reduce labor time while relying on it as the source of value. Here's how it breaks down: On one hand, capitalism, driven by competition, uses machines to make production more efficient, cutting down the amount of labor needed to produce goods. **This is good for capitalists because it lowers costs, increases productivity and increases surplus labor time**, enabling them to produce more goods for sale and increase profits. But, on the other hand, capitalism depends on labor time to measure value. **The more machines replace workers, the less labor is directly involved in making things, and the more difficult it is for capitalism to make a profit**. So, capitalism ends up in a bind: it needs to reduce labor to maximize profits, but at the same time, it relies on that same labor to generate value. This leads to overproduction, and the system becomes unstable, because the value is not being generated at the same rate by the labor that has been replaced by machines.\n\nTo be funnier, here's an AI generated podcast about it.

                                    "body": "Really funny how many people use the term \"late stage capitalism\" who also get upset about AI. Automation (reducing the absolute number of laborers total) is literally the thing that Marx says will cause a revolution and the collapse of capitalism.\n\n\"**A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers,**\u00a0***i.e.*****, enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution**, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development.\" - Capital, Vol 3, Ch 15\n\nHe also says this is inevitable and unavoidable due to competition:\n\n\"No capitalist ever voluntarily introduces a new method of production, no matter how much more productive it may be, and how much it may increase the rate of surplus-value, so long as it reduces the rate of profit. Yet every such new method of production cheapens the commodities. Hence, the capitalist sells them originally above their prices of production, or, perhaps, above their value. He pockets the difference between their costs of production and the market-prices of the same commodities produced at higher costs of production. He can do this, because the average labour-time required socially for the production of these latter commodities is higher than the labour-time required for the new methods of production. His method of production stands above the social average. But competition makes it general and subject to the general law. **There follows a fall in the rate of profit \u2014 perhaps first in this sphere of production, and eventually it achieves a balance with the rest \u2014 which is, therefore, wholly independent of the will of the capitalist.**\" - Capital, Vol 3, Ch 15\n\nAnd how does he feel about the machinery itself?\n\n\"**It took both time and experience before the workpeople learnt to distinguish between machinery and its employment by capital, and to direct their attacks, not against the material instruments of production, but against the mode in which they are used**. The contests about wages in Manufacture, pre-suppose manufacture, and are in no sense directed against its existence. The opposition against the establishment of new manufactures, proceeds from the guilds and privileged towns, not from the workpeople.\" - Capital, Vol 1, Ch 15",

Politicians and oligarchs seem to be basically incapable of long-term thinking, they care about unemployment/wages only as far as the next election or quarterly report. What, do you think they're suddenly going to sit up and become deeply concerned with the plight of the working man?\n\n>We won the culture war on gay marriage\n\nCounting your chickens a bit early there, mate, we haven't won shit yet. Gay marriage is on the chopping block as we speak (and almost definitely getting rolled back), so we're sliding back to Aughts-era devolved rights soon.\n\nAnd waiting out the old fucks isn't gonna work either because they just keep grooming new fascists and capitalists to replace them\u2014and since it's a small club they don't need many of them. They were never just going to die off, that was always an opiate to keep millennials from getting too ornery until we got chained to the treadmill like our predecessors.\n\n>caused by unemployment due to automation\n\nRight, you know that, and I know that. But the median voter, soup-brained as they are, is easily duped into believing it's caused by immigrants or trans people or the gays, or whatever boogeyman their corporate-controlled feed tells them to hate next. Like I said, Marx was 100% on the ball with what capitalists would do...he just didn't account for working class people to be so absurdly gullible.\n\n>we have widespread societal support for a fucking CEO Assassin so we're not exactly as pro-capitalist a society as you seem to think we are\n\nWe *had* widespread support a month ago, then the media machine got churning, turned some people against him, and distracted all the rest with whatever new bullshit came up. Just another diversion to siphon people's energy and attention. People cheering over one flashy act of violence and then settling back into their seats with no change is textbook \"bread and circuses\".\n\nSociety doesn't have to be pro-capitalist for capitalism to keep feeding on it, so long as we're too weak and divided to fight it off. It's a system that's rather good at putting even adversarial forces to use in perpetuating itself.",

Working class people are not interested in bettering things for everyone, they've been successfully convinced that only those ***deserving*** should have it better. The working class will not choose socialism for themselves, they will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into that better future. It's not doomer to be realistic about that.",

They legit do not care about the long term.\n\nIt's the MBA/corporate raider mentality and it's basically the standard amongst the managerial/c suite class in America. They've been educated to think operating ratios are like THE most important thing and it's reenforced by the investor incentive structure. You're rewarded based on quarterly performance, which means cost cutting is valued basically the same as improving the business or product and is MUCH easier to achieve.\n\nWhich should be obvious given how many of them think the US rail industry is super good (because they have really insane ratios) when in reality it's the corpse of a whale who died mid-swim and hasn't quite hit the bottom yet.",

They were even offered training to transition from being an \"Angular Andy\" to someone skilled in system design, solution architecture, and the like. Less than 10% bothered with those learning paths, brushing it off as fearmongering from the suits.\n\nIronically, the same ones who spend four hours a day on Stack Overflow just to get their shit going, and need two hours of meetings every day so I can explain for the fifth time that week how I want my REST API structured, were the ones who thought they were absolutely indispensable. \"I don't worry, it's just a stochastic parrot\". Hilarious.\n\nI know every dev on Reddit thinks they're the smartest mf ever, but out of the hundreds of devs I\u2019ve had to manage so far, 80% are easily replaceable, and are getting replaced. Their actual dev skills didn't match their inflated ego at all. Like, we even did workshops showing what SOTA AI can do, and how I create a production-ready app in a fraction of the time... then those fucks accused me of staging my demonstration. Holy shit. I hope the parrot teaches them some humility.\n\nYou can also see it in the tech subs how everybody is \"it won't ever replace me\" while in the same sentence admitting their horizon just goes up to ChatGPT. So basically, they don\u2019t know shit about AI at all except chatting with some mainstream chatbot, but think they have some kind of authority on the topic. This is going to be a rude awakening for some.\n\nMeta stopping hiring mid-level engineers and us letting them go is just the beginning. But even news like that get brushed off like, \"Meta doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. They\u2019ll hire them again next year\". Mindblowing cognitive dissonance... hallucinations worse than an open-source LLM running on a Raspberry Pi. But at least the LLM is capable of learning.\n\nI realized my professional days were numbered back when the transformer paper was published. I was reading it with some colleagues, and all five of us in that room instantly knew what this paper meant (or at least we had an idea... being 100% sure of it came in 2020 after the GPT-3 paper dropped). That was long before anyone even knew what an LLM was... seven years ago. Those exact frontend devs who aren\u2019t with us anymore were the ones laughing the loudest at my \"fear of parrots\".\n\nWell, thanks to my paranoia, I have absolutely no problem with getting replaced in 3\u20135 years or whenever. Finally, I\u2019ll have time to do whatever I want and pursue some of my hobbies. Perhaps I\u2019ll even keep some pet parrots.",

I mean research scientists, ethicists, economists etc.\n\nThat's not to say that they all agree with what will happen, but the idea that these models are not capable and not getting rapidly better is inexistent in those discussions. \n\nLook up o3, then look up frontier math, swebench, arcagi etc. if you don't know what any of these things mean, ask an llm that can search the Internet because most of this is too new for it to be in the training data. Swebench and arc agi excluded, but definitely the interplay between them all.\n\nLong story short, shit is getting very very real.",

This is a big problem with capitalism. It assumes a class of people that can afford goods and services at prices that guarantee profit to the capitalists. The middle class, right now, is the class that usually buys most of those products and services.\u00a0\n\n\nThe second problem is enforcement of ownership. If the military class stops being \"middle class\" and slides firmly into \"cannot afford anything\" class then you risk them revolting (since they hold the true key to power, the finger on the trigger) and then good luck saying that a factory is \"yours\" it now belongs to whoever the military decides it belongs to.

For example, the human brain is not equipped to handle what social media does to it. We can't maintain good mental health while being bombarded by so much information from all around the world 24/7. I don't believe that smartphones or social media have made life better insofar as human happiness goes.\u00a0Tech has destroyed human community. Why does AI *need* to be \"progress\"? If you want to argue it's an arms race with the first nation to successfully develop AI having more power, that's one thing. But I am immensely skeptical that AI will achieve anything other than more alienation for humanity. It doesn't truly replicate the human mind successfully so all I see is a lot of bullshit alienating meaningless low quality content being spewed at the cost of our environment. If you want to argue that it reduces work, I'm not sure that that's really all it's hyped up to be either. Reducing manpower just enriches the people who control the means of production. The pain and suffering that AI is going to cause for the working class can't possibly be worth it.",

Support networks, independently of whether a person has ever been declared \"mentally ill\" in their life or not, need to actually take people's needs into account (someone to talk to without any risks of psychiatric institutionalisation, sometimes just shelter for a few nights) and treat them as the autonomous human being they are. https://www.madinamerica.com/2023/12/reimagining-crisis-support-tina-minkowitz/",

They were dumped onto the streets.  It was a tax-cutting move.\n\nHaunting question:  you are a hospital.  You have just checked in a patient showing early signs of Ebola (or pick your favourite lethal contagious illness).  That person insists on their \"civil rights\" to refuse treatment and check themselves out, thus exposing the general public to risk of infection and your city to risk of being ground zero for a spectacular epidemic.  Do you justify holding/treating that patient against their will?  Is it unconstitutional to do so?",

Certainly not the new underclass cos they've got no money. The price of the goods being produced at x1000 the previous rate are now practically worthless which is okay as the cost of production is pretty much zero as well. There is practically infinite supply and no demand due to the fact that 99% of the world has no money. Capitalism, the economy and the concept of a livelihood don't survive into the next century. That's not to say there won't be some short-term pain for everyone but at the other side is the prospect that every human on Earth can have their needs met for practically zero cost without the need to spend a third of their working hours labouring for it.",
