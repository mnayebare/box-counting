This question is about screening foreigners at the border.  Americans have a nearly unlimited free speech.  Foreigners do not have an unlimited right to come here.  The conditions under which we admit someone should be restrictive.\n\nUnder Biden, we let Hamas members in the country and we didn\u2019t do any screening.  This isn\u2019t he most elegant thing but it\u2019s something.  Something is better than nothing when it comes to border security.",

Same government who invaded Iraq under the pretense of WMD in front of the world when it\u2019s about killing Saddam Hussein, whose absence led to the collapse of the Iraqi state and gave birth to ISIS. Soldiers dead because of the government lying to go to war.\n\nWhy the hell do people suddenly become very trustful of them when the government says \u201coh, we deported him because he\u2019s a member of Hamas\u201d or \u201cwe\u2019re deporting this PhD student because she\u2019s a Hamas sympathizer\u201d. To what extent does their use of AI is limited to those who harbor hostile intentions against America? To foreigners only, or even just from \u201cthose countries\u201d? Better yet, how does one control the government to *objectively* define \u201chostile intentions\u201d without overstepping its boundaries?\n\nAgain, and I want to make this very clear to everyone: let\u2019s be honest about your stance on immigration. If we want to see purity tests so be it, but do not ever think it\u2019s anything different than China\u2019s own **totalitarian** system. It deprives people of their liberty just because they *think* differently.",
