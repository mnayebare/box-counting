Two more qualified white doctor applications (they attended better ranked medical schools and had more experience) were tossed out so the hiring board could hire a black doctor to run that program who graduated from a lower ranked medical school and had less experience. Instead of judging each candidate equally on their credentials, racial discrimination was used to hire the black doctor. One of the people on the hiring committee said they wanted to get a black doctor for cultural fit and ignored the hard data showing the other two were more qualified. If someone had done the reverse and neglected two black doctors for a lesser quality white doctor due to \"cultural fit\", there would be justifiable cries of racism. Same should apply to what happened. \n\nNo company you may have been involved in has done it but the factual reality for the American economy is these acts do happen. \n\nI work in government contracting and there are definite minority set asides for small businesses. White business owners are rejected from competing on certain government contracts (funded with their tax dollars) so certain jobs are denied to white business owners through such racism (if race is being used as a factor to exclude certain people, it's racism)\n\nThe solution should be government supported well paying jobs for all so there is no need to fight over crumbs like this",

Talent is equally distributed across all races and genders, because obviously it is, and if you have even a beginners understanding of biology and genetics you understand why it has to be given what we know about the human species. And then some people get rejected more often in more interviews because some of the bosses who got their jobs in a segregated or sexist time and grew up in a segregated or sexist community just \u201ccan\u2019t see the fit.\u201d This happens every day. The point of workplace recruitment and anti-discrimination plans is to ensure everyone gets a fair shake, because the standard is to not get a fair shake and without addressing it most jobs would go to someone who went to school with the boss or knows the boss\u2019s Dad. My beloved husband, my Dad, my brothers, and some my best friends are all straight white dudes, and none of them mind this at all because they too work hard, know that they won\u2019t get everything they ever want, but they can get far by being their wonderful, talented selves. There is more than enough in the world for everyone to have a piece of the pie. The only people in the world to whom workplace fairness and anti-discrimination is threatening are the rich segregationists who have temporary control of our government, because they know they didn\u2019t get where they are on their merits, and if we move towards fairness at all they might lose what they have to people with more talent and effort than they possess. It would be sad, if it didn\u2019t hurt so many people so needlessly.",
