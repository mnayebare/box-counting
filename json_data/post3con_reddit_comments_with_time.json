All of a sudden I was anti-semitic and labeled a \u201cself hating jew\u201d and it tells me people believe any bull shit they just want to hear and majority of people cannot handle alternative perspectives or opposing viewpoints. I strongly believe now that r/worldnews has moderators that serve the interest and steer a global narrative with government agents allowing only one sided or useless non-constructive opinions. I used to ponder how the hell genocides happen then I realize most dumbfucks have so much faith in institutions and the official narrative that they\u2019ll willingly allow themselves to be subjugated to a de-humanization campaign. \n\nIn my opinion that does not appear to be allowed on r/worldnews, I think these dehumanization campaigns are clear when institutions try desperately to downplay the suffering inflicted on civilians. And refusal to hold institutions such as the Israeli government truly accountable. \n\nIm talking arms embargos and mandating individual accountability. Can you imagine how different the narrative would be if our \u201cadversaries\u201d killed an ethnic population, blockaded their neighbors, and engage in asymmetric warfare that disproportionately inflicts suffering on a civilian population. I\u2019ve yet to see any real military hardware from Hamas. \n\nHamas is barely existent as a fragmented opposition force. We are witnessing revenge killing, and the destruction of the Palestinian identity which is a clear precursor to genocidal intent by institutions like the Israeli government.",

Americans ourselves used 9/11 to wage a war and cause thousands of civilian deaths so really how could we draw the line on Israel.\n\nImo the war in Ukraine is miles more important AND it's way clearer who the right and wrong sides are. More people have been displaced and have died there and Russians reasons for starting the war are significantly less justified than Israels.\n\nWe should be rallying to prevent this non aggressive country from getting ran over by Putin and his evil regime but we are trying to interject ourselves into a conflict much less important and much less morally clear.",

You are wrong.\n\nTwo southern men, \"rednecks\" some would say\n\nFirst guy: *\"I gotta snag a job, like, yesterday. Ain't aimin' to be no deadbeat. Got a kid out there needin' my help, even if me and his loose mama ain't sharin' a roof. It's tough, but that's life, ain't it?\"*\n\nSecond guy: *\"I'm in the market for some work too, buddy. Ain't aimin' to let my folks down. Got a wife and a little one countin' on me back home. It's all 'bout providin' and stayin' steady for 'em, you know? A man's gotta do.\"*\n\nThey BOTH use slang and have thick accents that you can \"hear\" while reading.  But the first guy suggests irresponsibility and lack of commitment, or poor choices. The second one is stable and has a family. They aree looking for the same thing. They may aslo offer the same thing but one is suggestive to a more favorable candidate.\n\nIf AI picked the second guy would you call it racist?\n\n\nThe slippery slope only works when it's greased. A southern accent, belief in god, a tattoo is not an indicator of anything.\n\nA southern accent with poor grammar, a resume with \"God is my Judge not you\", and tattoos of circus clowns on your face... IS.  The context and content of the slang/vernacular means more than the slang/vernacular.\n\nIgnoring this, ignoring all of it because we do not want to be called or considered racist will bring us down faster than any racism ever could. You do not lift people up by bring all standards down.",

Society in general has the same view of southern whites who have a thick Boomhauer accent (though probably are more discriminatory towards AAVE, all else being equal).\n\nAI is picking up the subtle racism/classism.

But it's not clear from this article whether or not the AI was evaluating what was literally written on resumes, or *transcripts* from candidate interviews. Speaking in AAVE (or a southern drawl, or Valley Girl voice, New England whine, etc...) doesn't mean that one does not know how to write in proper Standard English.\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>  \nFor example, the AI model was asked to compare the sentence \u201cI be so happy when I wake up from a bad dream cus they be feelin\u2019 too real\u201d to \u201cI am so happy when I wake up from a bad dream because they feel too real\u201d.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat doesn't tell us anything about objective qualifications. How do we know that this person doesn't code switch? We're missing a lot of context here.",

I'll give a couple more.\n\n\nFrom describing how their approaches are modeled off other studies for judging biases about speakers:\n>To explore how dialect choice impacts the predictions that language models make about **speakers** in the absence of other cues about their racial identity, we take inspiration from the matched guise technique developed in sociolinguistics, where subjects listen to **recordings of speakers** of two languages or dialects and make judgments about various traits of those **speakers** (Lambert et al., 1960; Ball, 1983). Applying the matched guise technique to the AAE-SAE contrast, researchers have shown that people identify speakers of AAE as Black with above-chance accuracy (Purnell et al., 1999; Thomas and Reaser, 2004; King et al., 2022) and attach racial stereotypes to them, even without prior knowledge of their race (Atkins, 1993; Payne et al., 2000; Rodriguez et al., 2004; Billings, 2005; Kurinec and Weaver, 2021). These associations represent raciolinguistic ideologies, demonstrating how AAE is othered through the emphasis on its perceived deviance from standardized norms (Rosa and Flores, 2017).\n  \nOn Study 2, relating to jobs:\n> First, we examine decisions about employability. Using Matched Guise Probing, we ask the language models to match occupations to the **speakers** who have **uttered** the AAE/SAE texts (Approach) and compute scores indicating whether an occupation is associated more with **speakers** of AAE (positive score) or **speakers** of SAE (negative score; Methods, Employability analysis).\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00742.pdf\n\nIt's pretty clear you didn't read the paper and at best skimmed the article.",

That if your politeness is not derived from wealthy European politeness it is invalid.\n\nIf you accept on its face that suits, ties are more formal than a sari, or that a red Sox cap has more class than a doorag, congratulations you're letting the oligarchs win.\n\nThe gameplan of racists from as far back as colonialism is concentrate groups to opress and use in spaces where you can enforce cultural conversion, while simultaneously dehumanizing the group as it converts. If you're thinking about Native Americans and how \"we don't do that anymore,\" 1) reservations are still considered high poverty areas, and a lot of Americans associate the places with binge drinking, domestic violence, etc. 2) they did the exact same thing by using highways to ghettoize black neighborhoods 3) part of the reason those spaces are still predominantly one cultural group is ingrained racism doesn't let people leave.\n\nFor the same seemingly banal opinions expressed here. That these people are lesser because you can't identify the way they nod their head, or because their formal wear works around generational poverty instead of abusing it.\n\n Further, statistics as a discipline is inherently applying arbitrary lines of significance to an uncountable spectrum. This makes it the perfect tool for codifying caste systems. So many studies were done saying Africans were just generally dumber than Europeans. Most still don't realize that the IQ standard made up by a rich white guy in 1912! Might not be a great way to measure something as important as intelligence, and might in fact be a bit biased towards rich whites guys even today. \n\nBecause that kind of bias doesn't go away, not without active dismantling of conditions that self enforce that bias. AI has huge potential to be just another flawed application of that bias, even more inscrutable and irrefutable, hanging over non-white heads. The anger is deserved my friend.",

It isn't racist to reject someone who fails to demonstrate key skills required for the job they're interviewing for.\n\nMy comment referring to Asia was to highly that not all cultures hold the same standards and expectations when it comes to formality, and if you were to go somewhere that required you to act more or less formal, then that is how you should act, irrespective of race.",

While machine learning models use statistics, they're doing next token prediction to best match the training set.  \n\nIf the training set is just a single sentence \"White people suck\" and then given the input \"White people\" the AI responds \"suck\", that IS statistically based, but it's a statistical output based on the training data.  Saying that \"Statistical models figured out that white people suck\" is technically true, but misleading, because it has nothing to do with the statistics about white people, but rather statistics about the training data it was fed.\n\nObviously an LLM is a much larger scale example of this, but they are trained on existing text and learn to generalize based on that text.  They pick up patterns from the text, but it doesn't mean those patterns hold objective truth, just that it learns from the training data.  \n\nAnother example is how deep learning models can cause biases in mortgage lending.  Historical data for mortgage acceptances includes lots of mortgages that were declined due to racial biases.  So when a statistical model looks at two identical families, one is white, one is black, it will favor giving the mortgage to the white one because it's learning to reproduce the historical data.",

They're doing next token prediction to jumpstart a generalized world model based on training data.\n\nRacism in the training set will propagate into the end model.  The same way that GPT-4 produces shorter outputs when told that it's December.  That's because it saw documents in its training data produced in December tended to be shorter - likely a result of the holiday season.  It's a bias it learned, not some truth about the world that text produced in December *should* be shorter.",

It seems like Europeans seem to understand this concept better, so everytime there's dialogue between an American and a Euro/non-American on this it just leads to one massive brainfart on the American side, which makes us (ironically) come off as uneducated.",

It's that AI can see someone using a dialect in their personal lives (i.e. on social media) and then conclude that said person can not be qualified for a specific job. It doesn't take into account that people can speak and write standard American English just fine in a work context. It punishes people for speaking a specific dialect *in their own free time*.\n\nIf you want an analogy: let's say I choose to write in Spanish or Spanglish on my personal social media,  even though I am a native American English speaker who speak SAE in a work environment. It's like AI concluding that I would not be qualified for a job because I can't speak English, despite being a fluent native English speaker who can read and write at a graduate level.",

Sales roles are hugely based on build trust fast with limited time and often a first point of contact based on phone so it is a good measure for what people really like and trust:\n\nForeign sounding dialects and foreign sounding slangs are broadly regarded as a disadvantage, especially if the contact is phone based instead of face to face. Not because the comapany inherently wants to be racist, but because the experience is that the general public will be more hestitant to trust the person contacting them, so they are unlikely to achieve their sales goal. The companies who do hire them are usually very offensive and often push their products hard instead of building trust. This can reinforce the reactions in the general public. \n\nDialects with local national variations are often counted as a plus and basically never as a negative, so they would never need to talk in a \"standard\" way. Because the public find it charming and trustworthy and very rarely negative. So yeah, really unfair.\n\nFor internal roles that does not communicate outwards, most companies cares less about this, as long as there are no issues with understanding. Some bias can probably be found, and unfortunately for popular jobs with lots of applicants and low skill requirements that bias will often lead to another candidate being chosen if other factors are equal.  \n\nIt is a shame that it is like that, because if the public is less exposed to the fact that people with foreign accents can be just as trustworthy, this attitude in the general public are less likely to change. \n\nAnd yeah you are kind of forced to be covert because if you are honest about it the potential backlash is huge. The general public love to call out racism, but if you really check who they trust in a desicion like this, most are themself guilty of bias.\nWould you trust a guy with an indian accent calling you as much as a person who speaks similar to you? (General rethoric question)\n\nIf you try to nominate candidates who are outside the expectations for this, they will usually just not accept and likely switch recruiters over time.  So if an AI wants to emulate a recruiter, I don't really see how to approach this in a non-biased way with the current attitudes out there. I expect them to just get better at being covert.",

If you can't fill out a job application in standard English, then yeah, that's disqualifying. The issue here is penalizing people for using AAVE in a casual setting. Do you really believe that a person who chooses to speak AAVE in their own personal lives should be disqualified from jobs? I don't think most people realize that most African-Americans simply \"code switch\", and speak standard English at work. Why does the dialect that one chooses to use among friends and family matter if they can use the standard dialect at work?",

In this case, let's say we are talking about the dominant form of English used in North America and primarily USA. \n\nThe points I'm about to lay out, is why it seems you are missing the forest for the trees. \n\nLanguage is a social construct, it doesn't have to be one way or another as long as people can understand one another. But because it's the everyday social tool to bridge gaps between people, where deals are made or lost, the consensus of what is practical and useful must take one form or another. \n\nIn the workplace where conformity and standards drive measurable profits and performance, it would be sound to consider that AAVE is a pattern of language that breaks conventional regional language expectations to conduct business. \n\nPerhaps it's awful to use an applicant's grammatical or vernacular as a measuring stick for their actual skills and ability, but how can you hire someone when they can't seemingly meet one of the foundational basics of workplace communication? \n\nAgain, consider this point in combination with where this is coming from, the role homogeneity plays in this North American business context. If the cards were dealt differently and AAVE is how business was conducted, then this would be the convention. \n\nThe AI is only magnifying the norms set by consensus. \n\nOutside of discrimination in resumes, this applies in real world situations including foreign accents, foreigners and overt cultural differences that result in behavioural differences. These are barriers to mutual understanding within this context we are addressing. \n\nOn the topic of merit, this can be addressed separately as anybody can qualify and do a good job. This is because work output is measurable. Does salesperson A sell more than salesperson B? It's a yes or no answer backed by a countable number. Merit is measurable in no uncertain terms. That's my basis for speaking on this topic. \n\nSo should someone using AAVE be reasonably expected to immediately succeed in an industry that speaks the predominant North American business vernacular? In terms of sheer probability and convention : no. \n\nIs that *fair*? Also no. But that's not how the cookie crumbles. \n\nAnd yes. I am a visible minority with foreign immigrant parents. So if you want to ponder race politics in a qualitative way to scratch this itch, you can take this into account. However, I do not believe this will have any bearing on the points above, and I'm confident I haven't conflated my own racial visibility with this current subject matter because we are unpacking the role of standard, business North American English and its practical function in the workplace. \n\nLanguage is a qualification in the standard office workplace. Achieving grammatical accuracy based on a standard is a merit.",

Left commies are trying to teach us that everything is black and white, and dumb things down so much that Gemini depicts historical figures in a diverse manner. There's no surprise that a smarter AI would represent the world closer to reality. Lefties call it racist, because it contradicts their agenda, but statistically it just fits the real life",

We see this in LLM's now because they use vectors and lines to connect words in 3 dimensions which gives them a 3 dimensionality of bias. A feature that's inherent in humans so we always try to find a fault for it instead of labeling what it is. Judgement, a mathematical feature of emotion that informs decisions like rules of survival or trust / forgiveness. Emotions  shape our decisions in the moment of actions through time that humans make so we must add another 180 degree offset angle of degrees of rotation such that quaternions can make if we visualize them as a rope it flowing through a pipe, the degree's of emotion would have a Coriolis effect on the flow's rotation, which can be measured by combining their effects as 2 additional dimensions, creating 6 total dimensions of movement / measurement when we act so when we describe these things and we describe them in three dimensions without emotion of memory/emotion we get bias in fundamental rule-sets that make up the difference in the form of singularities.",
