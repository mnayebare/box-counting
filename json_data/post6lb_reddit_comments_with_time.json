As a result, crime prediction and predictive policing have stirred controversy with the latest artificial intelligence-based algorithms producing limited insight into the social system of crime.\n\n> Such predictions enable us to study perturbations of crime patterns that suggest that the response to increased crime is biased by neighbourhood socio-economic status, draining policy resources from socio-economically disadvantaged areas\n\nIf the reports don't exist, I don't know what they expect police officers to do to be unbiased. Go into low income areas and meticulously patrol until they find the quantity of crime the stats predict?\n\nI am an engineer working with AI. I am highly skeptical of any use of AI in the criminal justice system, and my default opinion is it has no place at all.",
