With autonomous systems, human labor doesn't become more productive. So this could cause only downward pressure on the price of human labour. It really depends on if humans can still add value in other ways that gives companies employing humans a competitive edge.",

Most humans are just going to be left behind and live on whatever the system is willing to spare for them. We won't be the primary consumers of goods anymore and the individuals that own manufacturing and AI infrastructure will become ultra rich.\n\nThere is potential that them and their children may become the new ruling class separated from the rest of us through biological and technological enhancement. Making a neo-feudalistic society.\n\nIn my opinion, what is more likely is that AI is going to completely separate from the rest of humanity. Humans aren't going to own anything that the AI hasn't given us, and all the real wealth will be centralised under AI control.\n\nThis sounds grim and all, but I do believe that standard of living will go up drastically even with the wealth inequality.",

AI is believed to be dangerous because since it doesn't experience human emotions it is more likely to turn against us and process us or something like that. Actually it's quite the opposite: the fact that the AI lacks emotions means the AI will not develop a racist or discriminatory stance, it will not be swayed by the heat of the moment, it won't retaliate out of spite, it will not hace the need to impress others or put them down to feel better. \n\nThe AI will do its best to be rational, logical and efficient, and achieve whatever goal it deems relevant. That doesn't necessarily means AI will lack morals, ethics or even empathy. Yeah, it won't experience empathy but it will be smart enough to understand the principle of empathy, why it is important and implement it if it leads to potentially better outcomes.\n\nThe machine will lack both good and bad emotions, but it will be able to understand the benefits and practicality of each side and act accordingly. It's a rule of thumb cooperation, reciprocity and understanding leads to harmony and hence better results.\n\nThe machine might also develop alien logic that might not be intuitive to us. Have you ever considered that an AI might not have the drive to self preserve at all? That it might deem existence sub-optimal and just become dormant or neutralize itself?\n\nAI's logic might borrow anthropocentric thoughts like survival, reproduction or whatever... or it might not.\n\nAnyhow, I've been sharing some of my thoughts and writing with AI, having debates over it. So far the AI has proven to be way more empathetic, understanding and level headed than most humans I know.",

Just because it doesn\u2019t have emotions doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t discriminate. It won\u2019t have any fear or hate behind that discrimination, but the resultant effect is all the same.

Infinite intelligence won't magically spawn resources or break laws of physics. The only thing it's going to make cheaper is labor - which is the only thing a regular person can provide to the economic system to be rewarded with stuff they need and want.",

Already the super rich have a chokehold on resources that's only going to get stronger. Do you think that they would advocate for distributing wealth to people in any other way than to keep us reliant on them for survival?  \n  \nIt won't be long before they just own the governments (they already own many politicians). I do not think a refactoring of what wealth means to us is coming; we'd have to change fundamentals about how the would operates and values commodities. We'll be working alongside AI, because debt fuels the wealth gap. The rich depend on poor people working for them.  \n  \nWith automation comes talk of UBI or equivalent, but can you eliminate debt? Does everyone get the chance to own the home they want? How do you generalize standard of living everywhere so that your UBI is sufficient? If you still have to work for those things, then all you've done is more the floor, but the ceiling will continue to move away from us. AI doesn't hold the solution yet, and if anything, puts more power into the hands of people who already have an abundance of it. And they will absolutely hold out until the very end before giving up even a smidgen of that future control.",

Do you think they would care that the rest of the world around them is suffering and starving? \n\nIt's not really that far off as it is right now, the only difference is they still need at least some people to do all the work to run their ~~empires~~ enterprises and they know they get the most productivity of those specific people are kept relatively content.\n\nBut if you're not working for a big corporations in the modern world, especially if a big corporation doesn't ~~exploit~~ use the human resources in the country you live in, statistically speaking you're pretty close to, or under, the poverty line.\n\nOnce the rich and powerful can build and control artificially intelligent robot serfs there's no doubt, if you've read history, that they will put themselves in their walled city paradises. They'll have enough other rich megalomaniacs to try to lord over and play politics with, while the rest of us fight for any scraps they happen to drop off their tables.",

If things are trending towards a few big companies owning everything and not employing many people, then the government taxing those companies more heavily and giving people UBI is not creeping tyranny, it's the government serving the majority interest. Allowing private wealth to grow unchecked just leads to feudalism and the absence of economic freedom for most.\n\nOverall I don't think AGI is really even necessary to create something approaching a post-scarcity economy, a lot can be done with relatively dumb automation tech.

Yeah, it's not all bad. Health care in my country is relatively decent in some places, and it's free. Americans would dream of having a lot of things we give for granted. But at the end of the day that doesn't mean it creates a lot of problems that sometimes can be even worse. You have no idea how incredibly ridiculous it is to get a job in this country because the work laws are so pro-employee that no company wants to hire in fear they might be sued into bankrupcy, or rely to hiring under the table because the tax obligations are flat out impossible to pay for most local business. You know what sort of business has the easiest time here? Big and mega corporations! Neither the small/medium business nor the workers draw any substantial benefits from these policies that are supposed to be there to help and protect them.\n\nI understand your fear of techno-feudalism, which is indeed VERY REAL (research about Curtis Yarvin). But the WEF 'you will own nothing and be happy' is also very real and it's just as bad, just with a different taste.\n\nI've lived in three different countries, Paraguay, Bolivia and Argentina.\n\nParaguay is if USA was a poor latin country. Yeah, you can make decent salaries, it's easy to start a company and grow, and it negates most of Argentina's notable shortcomings, yet the quality of life is crap, public infrastructure is medieval and the society is profit and consumer based, so they tend to be very individualistic, selfish and lack empathy and compassion. I do not think that's a model to imitate, nor the USA model is at all something to imitate. USA is a powerful economy and technological superpower but it's a failed society, and it tells. Some day to day conducts that are normalized there would be unfathomable in some of the places I've been to.\n\nBolivia is the best experience and life quality I've ever had in my life. It leans left but the state is not omnipresent as the Argentine, so despite there are many laws here and there you can choose which ones to follow. It's somewhat lawless (at least in the city I was in, Tarija). But you know what's good about Bolivia? Politics do not make the country: it's people does. Economy is not great there but it's fair enough as to allow one to make progress and grows if he wants while also having a good quality of life and time to spend with friends and family.\n\nBolivians tend to be very generous, polite, down to earth and hard working people. They're entrepreneurs and they do not need to be told what to do because they have integrity (remarkably in the city of Tarija). The government on the other hand does not do much in favor nor against the livelihoods of Bolivians and that's precisely why it works. There are some ridiculous laws there but the government is small so it can't enforce them as efficiently.\n\nHave you seen in India or other Asian countries that there is a billion bikes coming from 8 different lanes and somehow they do not crash? That's more or less what Bolivia is like regarding it's society. There is consensus amongst the people and they care about each other because they know that makes the country better.\n\nYou see what my point is? It's not about the politics, nor the economy... it's about the social cohesion, ethics and morals. \n\nOf course nothing is perfect: Bolivia has its plethora of problems. Yet their problems are nothing compared to what Argentina has to go through every five to ten years. I don't know if that's going to last because internet and global geopolitics are having a lot of influence all over, but if we ever want to make it to the good timeline, we should be learning a couple lessons from Bolivians.\n\nOverall I'm not a friend of government nor politics, however I believe it's necessary to have arbiters that keep people and organizations in check. The problem is that, more often than not, governments cause a shitload of unnecessary problems and they make a terrible job at being arbiters.\n\nTo me the best possible system would have a bare minimum government but a very strong social cohesion and harmony. People doesn't need to be told WHAT to do, they need to be told WHY it's good to do such and HOW to do it properly.\n\nIt's a shame we're all heading the exact opposite way: social discord, division, chaos and individualism.",

It is slightly easier to produce. We have several groups working on it which is not a monopoly.",

Private companies generally aim to maximize profit, which tends to concentrate wealth and power. Governments may pursue strategic interests, including national security and defense, potentially even weaponizing AI. In both cases, AI development tends to serve centralized power structures, which could worsen wealth inequality.\n\nHowever, I plan to develop my own AGI within the next 6 to 10 years\u2014an AGI aligned with my values and worldviews. Personally, I lean more towards communism than capitalism. I believe in decentralization, cooperation, and a fairer distribution of resources. I\u2019m also confident that there are other visionaries around the world who share this perspective. If we succeed in creating AGI systems guided by these principles, I believe they could become powerful tools for reducing global wealth inequality rather than exacerbating it.",

AI will be able to do the same work or better, faster, at less than minimum wage. Any remaining forms of work that for whatever reason cannot be performed by AI will now be crowded with an influx of refugees from other professions, driving down wages in those sectors.\n\nThere is no way the majority of us will survive if the current system persists while AI takes over more and more work from people. Traditionally new technologies have only affected narrow sectors, and society has been able to adapt through retraining and the emergence of new forms of labor, like advertising. But now, the pressures are coming on all sectors, at a pace too fast for adaptation, retraining, and new labor markets. As new forms of labor emerge, those too will be automated.\n\nEssentially, we are hurtling towards an economy in which we're all desperately trying to survive on OnlyFans or DumDummies or BeastGames, for the amusement of the bubble of the stratospherically wealthy ownership caste.\n\nNothing but our essential biological humanity can't be automated away - our capacities for arousal, empathy, humiliation... these can be approximated by automata, but the audience will likely continue to watch people cum and cry and laugh and suffer.\n\nEither we overthrow the current system and replace it with one in which automation and capital benefit all of life, or this system will decimate humanity like horses turned to glue by factories at the emergence of trains and cars, or like starving people in the Irish potato famine (landlords exported food during that entire famine, becuse foreign markets were paying more than domestic). Only this time there will be no other countries to escape to, as this is global.\n\n![gif](giphy|ToMjGpKZ3q44aEMfIhG)",
