Notably also the point of Google Brain and their pathways; and if we want, back to pre-DL ensemble models.\n\nI don't see it as more than a trick to make training and inference at scale more feasible. You naturally won't get higher scores than training a single network of the same size.\n\nIt does seem very interesting to make use of it though and the primary reason that it is not done more is just cause the tooling is immature.\n\nIt should be interesting as a way to reduce training and inference demands. Some, imagine, also would like to use it for local models to specialize different models. I think that is not immediately relatable to what OpenAI did though and probably requires more experimentation. The most notable difference is that the local application would not want all pieces of the network in any memory for all the inference steps.",
