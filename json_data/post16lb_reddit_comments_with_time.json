There are complexities to use though in practice. \n\nFirst, you have legal ramifications of use that have not been sorted out enough. A lot of AI tools have TOS that prohibit commercial use, for one. Yet there are many who use the outputs commercially - how do you compete with others using tools they should not be using, not currently being cracked down on by large companies like Adobe? (Their recent Photoshop beta release which added generative AI includes TOS specifically stating it\u2019s not permitted for commercial use likely due to licensing). \n\nSo as a business owner, the legal risk is a concern. It\u2019s pretty low likelihood that I\u2019d have legal action taken against me but everyone who runs a business feels that way until it happens.",

While the composition of what it presents may look \"original\", the works it used to generate those images may be copyrighted, patented, or even duplicates of other AI generated art.   \n\n\nAs a photographer, you'll always have a need to have original, authentic work. The problem with AI is that you cannot guarantee with 100% certainty that it will always deliver the result you want. I recently read about a court case regarding several airlines in which one of the researchers for the plaintiff used ChatGPT as a \"source\" for looking up case material to reference. Needless to say, the cases that ChatGPT provided were entirely fictitious and derailed one side of a fairly large court case. The judge was not happy.  \n\n\nEven if you can prompt AI to do something, you'll still need humans to ensure the authenticity - particularly in art - and you'll still need humans making sure that the AI is producing what you expect.   \n\n\nImho I wouldn't be as worried about AI as some people are.

You have to incorporate continuous learning into your repertoire, as much as you have to make yourself go to the gym. \n\nIf you want to remain a photographer, then you have to master and keep mastering all the new techniques and tools and technology and tricks (three T's?) that come down the pike, perhaps taking classes or visiting expos or networking with colleagues, and help drive the field forward, rather than letting others do so. Think instead of the AI adding capabilities / efficiencies / cost savings / artistic possibilities to the field, rather than AI taking something away.
