They aren't going to tell you if you're not doing well, or even if you are doing well. Either you'll stop getting projects, or you'll start getting better projects. That's how they communicate, and you may never get a second chance. That may be something you dislike, but they're not a scam. They pay reliably, work is unlimited, and my pay is up to $30 hourly with no coding. You must have a precise, nitpicky, logical, perfectionist personality type, or you may struggle. If those things come naturally to you, you can monetized that with DAT. \n\nHowever, I would never count 100% on any online contract work personally. I'm fairly risk averse, so I have other means of replacing this income immediately if it goes away tomorrow. \n\nI'd also caution you that long hours doing analytical work with maximum effort can cause quality to slip. Most people struggle to produce top quality work after many hours of focus. When I feel like I'm struggling to focus, I take breaks. I'd rather make less that day than ruin a good gig by turning in subpar work.",

So far, I've been promoted into a reviewer role, and I continue to have a ton of work available 24/7. This isn't my only means of income, but it sure has been helpful. As a gig I can do in my jammies in my home office as much or as little as I please, I've been very happy with it. Started in November 2023 and no complaints so far after earning many thousands of dollars which was all paid out as promised right down to the minute. I actually have far more complaints about my professional full time job than DAT.\n\nI see you do a ton of gig work where you work as an independent contractor which is no different than DAT, so why are you singing out DAT in particular?  DAT is much better than any of the others you listed and those you listed are also not secure. Yet you aren't complaining about being insecure or being enslaved. Huh. Were you rejected by DAT? Because it seems like you're just mad about not being selected. Sour grapes.",

I\u2019m a student, so this kind of work is absolutely perfect for me in terms of the flexibility, but I\u2019m petrified that if I ramp up my hours a little then I may lose it altogether. So far everything\u2019s gone well; I\u2019m consistently getting more (and higher-paying) tasks on my dashboard and I\u2019ve increased my hours slightly, but given what I\u2019ve heard about people being shut down for earning too much, I\u2019m curious to hear what hours others are putting into the platform, especially someone like yourself who has been doing this for so long.",

How it works is you put $100 (bitcoin) into what they call a work account. This money is used to optimize products for merchants. The work is fast and simple. You make $50 in pay and $40 in commission a day, then you get that and your $100 backs at the end of the day. Here is the clincher. They have a \"Random\" bonus system. If during your 3 sets of tasks (40 each) you hit a bundle you get 15-100% the regular commission. I got one during training. I think I got an extra $8. 1st day went smooth but the person training confused me more than helped me. 2nd day I hit another bundle. Here's the part they don't for-warn you about. Now to continue to finish and get my money I have to put another $85 in. So, I cough it up, Finish the set, I get my $90\u00a0 plus $185 deposit and my extra $60. WhooHoo, right? Wrong! This is the scam. Next day, same thing except this time they need $475 more. Now, I'm on disability so I don't have that kind of money at my disposal. So I I use my rent. Start back up again BOOM! Another bundle, 1st task. What are the Random chances of that, right? Guess what? This time I have to pay $1471 to continue so I can get my new found fortune (haha) and my $575 back. I don't have that much money. No one mentioned this in \"training\" So, I'm out, I cant finish, I don't get paid my $90, my $575, MY money i put in or my 2 (15-100%) bonuses. I get nothing and now I can't pay rent due the next day. If I did have the money I probably wouldn't have done it any way $50 says once I started up again I'd get another bonus and this time it could be $4000. Fool me twice...Right!? So think about it before you work for them it's a scam from the get go. I have documented everything. If you want to see it or have questions, hit me back in the comments on this review. STAY AWAY, PLEASE. Leave the job to the little rich kids who can afford to have Daddys Money taken away. You can read their users guide but it doesn't mention paying more money to get your money back. If you ask they give vague answers and show you sweet innocent pictures of the person training you.(another lie)",

The math exam was easy imho. Physics was hard. Like I love physics, and I could not answer one of the questions at all. Biology was easy as long as you knew the subject they were discussing. If you don't know anything about genetic illness or Crispr or whatever subjects come up in your exam, you're gonna have a hard time. I did not try the chemistry exam because the example exam I saw earlier was over my head.... and I am a material scientist.\n\nSo in short, quite. The exams are quite hard. I have education and work experience related to these subjects and I found them challenging.",

THE NEXT MORNING after applying, I had access to the platform and 2 or 3 assessments. I took those, and they graded one of them 1 day later, and the other one more day after that.
