In my parent's native country Korea, they are having a whole bunch of issues of their own. For recap, couple months ago, S Korean president attempted a coup and failed. He was initially universally condemned and arrested. But his party is now convincing his base that hes the victim and to rally their support for him. Unreal. \n\nSo my question is, how did we get here, as a human society? I feel like things werent this divided couple decades back. What do you think was and is the leading cause of so much political division? Is it technology that is enabling miscommunication to spread like wildfire? Is it democracy hating foreign governments that is actively spreading extreme views? \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not saying legacy media was perfect, but most newspapers/tv channels had standards that filtered out the most nonsense and allowed the most useful information and atleast moderately well argued opinions into the public sphere.\n\nNowadays you have a much broader variety of options on where to draw your information and political takes from and a lot of people don't have good judgement when it comes from differenciating media content that's objectively good from media content that just caters to your pre-existing inclinations.\n\nThere are so many new media out there that, from my view, deliver low quality information or outright lies and just reinforce your world view without ever really enganging in honest critical self-reflection but that draw a large amount of people who happily deliver their attention and open their purses for the same slop over and over again.\n\nAnother part of the answer might be that we take a lot of liberal democratic achievements for granted and, for lack of better knowledge, don't see the dangers in some phenomena that are portrayed in a deceivingly positive way (\"executing the pure, unfestered will of the people\" for example - I mean who's to argue against democracy?) but run counter to central tenets of liberal democratic governance.\n\nThat and, what I feel as particularly annoying to me, is the trend to posit that \"freedom of speech\" somehow means that any articulation, may it be a truthful evidenced statement, a well argued opinion, a superfial comment, a death treat, a bunch of personal insults, makes the same contribution to the public good of having healthy and lively discussions about matters of political, societal and public moral importance.",

My point isn't that these technologies weren't around earlier, but that it took time for them to reach larger parts of the population comparable to what the Internet is achieving today. And by that time fascism had already become popular and taken hold in Italy and Germany.\n\n>I mean not really.

This legislation removed a barrier for disabled veterans and I'm glad it was passed.\n\nNext comes the part where the goal posts move and you dismiss, minimize and gaslight your way into how this legislation somehow wasn't authored by a conservative, or didn't help working class people. Bonus points for changing the subject, attacking someone's character, feigning indifference, or bailing on something that clearly helps people.\n\nThen again it is important to remember that everyone loses arguments sometimes. It's better to acknowledge when you're wrong and learn from the experience than to resort to excuses. But while I'm taking a victory lap, let's roll out some others.\n\n* [SB-269 Personal income taxes: Fire Safe Home Tax Credits Act](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB269)\n* [SB 353: Income tax: credits: food banks](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB353)\n* [AB-332 Employment safety: agricultural workers](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB332)\n* [AB 1938: Special education: inclusion and universal design for learning](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240AB1938)",

I'm not saying they don't exist, what I'm curious about is if you can point to legislation that specifically helps working class and not a subset of that class, and show that it is a policy of value. His claim is that no such legislation exists, you are disputing that I'm just wanting to see the receipts, unfortunately because his claim is no such policy exists I can't really ask him for receipts unless I want to look through every piece of proposed policy across the US. And for the record, \"of value\" in my mind does include something that isn't undercut by working of the party as a whole so like if a piece of legislation would make it easier for farmers to sell their products to USAID, that no longer is \"of value\".",

They run on policy and then don't do them at all. All they do is lie. Could you kindly show me a few policies that ACTUALLY HELPED?\n\nFor example, in UK, people agree immigration needs to be cut down, but what did the Tories do? They actually encouraged it, and Labour (leftwing party) exposed that fact alongside with the failure of their policy, once they were in power last year. They're claming down a lot on immigration, way more than Tories could ever in their 15 years or so. It's already been this long enough that they could've done something, yet they've managed to drive UK economy into the ground. Now, the Labour government is being blamed even though they are trying to make do. Even if we tried to inform people, the new rightwing party, Reform, would still have a rise of popularity. What's the point then?\n\nIt sounds so polarizing to you, but for me in Europe it is the simple truth right now. They at least used to be a serious party who just had a different way on going about things. But now, all they do is try to lie their way through, deflect from everything, create outrage, and so on...",

Any problem you have with mainstream media is with Fox News first and foremost. They're the most mainstream and widely-circulated media there is.\n\nol Rupe Murdoch spent a lot of money to make sure the American people were completely inundated with right wing talking points at every turn. When YouTube and social media became hot spots for media dissemination, right wing pundits eagerly seized on it, to make sure there the propaganda stream never let up.

You mention some important drivers of this phenomenon: the fracturing of the media ecosystem and foreign interference.\n\nAlongside tech-driven changes in media consumption, there has been a conscious effort to produce and promote partisan media.  Both sides have done this, but the right has been much more successful.  Right wing media, from radio in the 80s to podcasts today, has created a robust fantasyland that is now populated by most of the Republican base.\n\nOne thing I would add to your list is gerrymandering.  It isn\u2019t designed to increase partisanship, per se, but it creates safe partisan seats that tend to drive politicians on either side to pander to extremists instead of moderates.",

It's been amplified by decades of right wing media across all formats. \n\n> This just isn't a story of ideology, it's also a story of kind of attitude and style and tactics. Most of the congressmen that Gingrich helped elect or kind of gave power to were more conservative, but they were also \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 meaner and more aggressive and more combative and more confrontational. ...\n\n> Gingrich had this organization called GOPAC that he used to provide training to Republican candidates who wanted to emulate Newt Gingrich. He would send out cassette tapes and memos to these candidates providing them with kind of attack lines and and talking points and frankly created a whole new vocabulary for this rising generation of conservatives.\n\n> There was one memo I write about in the piece called \"Language: A Key Mechanism of Control,\" that literally included a list of recommended words that Republicans should use in describing Democrats. And they included words like \"sick,\" \"pathetic,\" \"lie,\" \"anti-flag,\" \"traitors,\" or \"radical\" and \"corrupt.\" ...\n\n> The kind of broader strategy when waging these national campaigns was to reframe the kind of policy debates in Washington that may have seemed kind of dull or inaccessible to the average American and turned them into these big struggles between good and evil, or white hats versus black hats, and a battle for the character and soul of America.",

The final question is how many people actually recognize that they might be politically illiterate? \n\nExpecting politically illiterate people to make good choices about who should run our government is like expecting someone who knows nothing about basketball to coach a team of players selected by people who know nothing about what a basketball player is supposed to be able to do.

It should be noted that the political calculus for Republicans before this was that the Democrats had a permanent house majority. Once Republicans won the House all three of the House, Senate and Presidency was up for grabs. \n\nBecause Gingrich did this by going to the right, there was this recognition that controlling media and the narrative and going partisan could lead to big gains. So political talking points became less about reaching across the isle and doing what was right for your constituents and moved towards winning for your particular partisan side so you could pass legislation in Congress and the house could pass it. \n\nInterestingly some of the biggest legislative wins for Republicans came in the 1990s under Clinton, but Clinton got a lot of the credit. Not wanting to share credit with the opposition party around the Obama era the Republican Senate decided to stonewall any legislation from passing under a Democratic President good or bad. This was because the goal was not to pass bipartisan legislation any more it was to get the Presidency, Senate and House and pass entirely partisan legislation.\n\nThe nation as a whole largely has molded into this same attitude towards politics. It's a Zero-Sum game the population sees it that way now because that's how it's seen in DC.",

There is a lot of false equivalency and both-sides-ism online, so let me be crystal clear:\n\n(a) There is a segment of religious conservative extremists who have been trying to take over the US for decades. Newt Gingrich and Pat Robertson were early examples of this, and they have only become more extreme over time.\n\n(b) Since at least the dawn of agriculture, there have been people trying to get obscenely rich and wield power over others. These people are immoral or amoral and will do basically anything to consolidate and hold power. Trump, Musk and Putin are prime examples of this.\n\n(c) The US was always and remains disturbingly sympathetic to Nazis. Neo-Nazis have and still do thrive in the US, taking advantage of free speech to promote their hate.\n\n(d) The US has been and remains a haven for racists and White Nationalists. This overlaps a lot with groups (a) and (c) but deserves special mention. They are similar but not identical.\n\n(e) Realize the US Constitution is old, it was never perfect and our form of government is subject to exploitation and corruption. This corruption had several watershed moments, but Citizens United in 2010 was a big one.\n\n(f) Foreign influence is a real thing. Putin in particular seems to be shaping opinions in other countries to serve his own needs via flooding social media with actual fake news, and China is likely doing the same. You don't need to utterly convince everyone of anything, you just need to plant the seeds of doubt about bedrock institutions like: the Mainstream Media, Congress, the Courts, free and fair elections, science, and so on.\n\n\\---------------------\n\nWhat you have today in the MAGA movement is the 1980's alliance between (a) and (b) in the GOP leveraging the corruption (e) to gain and hold more and more power. The secret sauce that pushed us over the edge was Trump abandoning even the illusion of decency and openly embracing -- without any consequences -- Nazis (c) and White Nationalists (d), which in turn forced Evangelicals (a) to utterly sell out their professed morality and embrace (c) and (d) too.\n\nThis created a political power block in the GOP which forced all conservatives to align with (c) and (d) whether they liked it or not. \"Either tow the party line or we will primary you out of office\" has been their entire strategy.\n\nThis trend has been aided by (f) all around the world.\n\nThe Democratic Party in the US is certainly corrupt. They are maddeningly inefficient and quarrelsome. But they are not part of anything I described above. At most you can say the Dems cater to the wealthy (b) while publicly denouncing them because they must if they want to get elected.",

A button that rewards them when they press it.  \n\nTake the Senate.  There are roughly 30 red states and 20 blue. If states *only* voted based on partisanship, the GOP would have a permanent supermajority.  But they don't vote that way, or at least they didn't.  Democrats won in red states regularly, and Republicans won in blue states. \n\nThat's 'non-polarized'.  The more polarized it gets, the more the Republicans win in the Senate. The more Supreme Court justices they get to confirm.  The less likely they are to see the Democrats win a supermajority and pass legislation.\n\nA similar thing has happened in the media. In non-polarized times, people chose news networks based on what other programming they had, or just out of habit.  In polarized times, they stick to the media that reflects back their biases, and consume more of it.  But that isn't equal; it seems to be more true of rightwing people than leftwing.  \n\nSo pressing the button, makes Fox News, Sinclair broadcasting, talk radio, etc. take a larger bite out of their respective markets.  \n\nThe only this positive feedback loop could have been stopped is if there was a chance for punishment along with the chance for reward. If networks could get censored, or if members of Congress feared they would be punished if their polarized actions crossed the line to illegal (e.g. Jan 6).  \n\nBut there was no chance for punishment. There never is.  Not for Republicans.",

Rainbow capitalism isn't \"left\". Have you seen how quick Google was at gesturing to the Trump administration that they're willing to drop \"woke\" holidays after the Trump administration had what it deemed \"woke\" holidays dropped from government calendars? The Trump administration didn't even ask/demand Google to do that, they just did. This is just companies using the aesthetics of progressivism if they think it helps their image or their bottom line.",
