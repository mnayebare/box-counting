Their base of wage slaves isn't going anywhere; they are simply being replaced with robots, and can now be expanded at-will.\n\nLet's say that they implement an annual tax on AI usage, such that the business pays whatever they were previously spending on paying employees, and then added an additional 1-5% of annual revenue to secure against future growth. Under that system, you can buy twice as many robots as you had employees and triple your profits in the first year while selling your products to the same customers for full price, and then pay the tax and still come out with doubled profits.\n\nLooking to the future, that same business could use that excess profit to buy more AI units and grow the business, receiving ever-increasing profit margins as they produce more, *as long as there are still enough people with money around to buy the products.* That can only happen if this plan is implemented, which is why it brings *everyone* together.",

We have the power to make this happen, but only together. Separately, this polarization will tear our Republic apart. Together we rise, separately we fall.",

I think that AI will--and should--continue advancing. \n\nFurther, I think that my plan to tax businesses based upon replacement of workers with AI will actually lead to an *increased* rate of development, because if we base an annual tax upon the prior year's employee cost plus a small percentage (1-5%) to secure against inflation and future growth (perhaps subtracting the cost of the AI units?), then they could buy 2-3 times as many AI units and produce significantly more products at a lower cost. This drastically increases their profits, such that they are more than overperforming by the end of the year, and the tax is a drop in the pond. \n\nThis provides a strong incentive for businesses to encourage AI development, reduces the incentive for people to discourage its development (as the economic issues disappear), and creates a system that *supports* the adaptation of AI by businesses.\n\nETA: It's also the only way that I see those businesses continuing to be able to grow, like they want to: as more people become unemployed, they won't have enough customers to support any growth. That is why the tax needs to grow as a percentage of their gross revenue: so that the UBI can accommodate more consumers.",

As this grows, AI takes more jobs, and more people enter the system, it transitions into a proper UBI where everyone gets a set amount that would be roughly equivalent to the median wage (currently $42,000).\n\nThis smooth transition would also allow us to be more precise about what exact values would work best once we reach proper UBI, and would reduce feelings of resentment towards those receiving it in the interrem, because their trade--their means of putting food on the table for their family--was directly taken away from them and others can start to see AI coming for their own.

There is no adaptation to be made with AI; that is the entire point of its design. \n\nAnd again: it's a tax on businesses, not individuals. Yea, I'm certain people will support this when those same people start being laid-off in droves. \n\n\nI thought we were going to do some math. What happened to that line of argumentation?

Change field entirely, and learn an entirely new skillset, only for that job to be automated too 2 years later? That simply does not stand up to reason. \n\n\n>Let's say it impacts 5% of the population in the United States, or 8.5 million out of ~170 million working adults\n\n>8.5 million x $40 K is $340 billion, annually.

So, if that 5% of the population is laid off as a result of AI, then the businesses that made the change will essentially pay the cost of those employee's annual salaries, minus the cost of any AI units they purchased that year, and all businesses will be taxed (let's go high) 5% of their annual revenue.\n\nThe Fortune 500 accounts for roughly $18.8 trillion in revenue as of 2024, and 5% of that is going to come out to $940 Billion in revenue alone. That helps to offset the early adoption being paid for by the government (as it is subtracted from the tax), and still leaves plenty to distribute to the people who had their livelihood taken away. \n\nThat's without taking into consideration that the individual businesses doing the replacing will *also* have the additional minor burden of paying the cost of the former employee's salaries directly for a year, which would add more to the pool.\n\nEdit: Actually, partial !delta because this has illuminated the fact that--after the first year--revenue would drop back to the 5% level. That tax on businesses would necessarily have to rise, equal to the unemployment rate.\n\nETA: To add on to this, I'm thinking that the real starting rate is likely to be closer to 30%, because--historically--that is around the point where people start rioting in the streets and trying to overthrow governments. Let's try to aim just a little below there, and keep improving on this plan in the meantime.",

While I still believe it to be possible, that does make it harder to sell to businesses and the upper class, and is something I had not considered. \n\nOn the other hand, it does give the innovative businesses time to profit highly off of the low-cost labor in the process, before the tax goes up. This may also help regulate how many people are still employed after UBI gets implemented in-full, who would effectively become the upper class.\n\nETA: The rest of my math is in the other comment, I had to make this one to properly award the comment.",
