It\u2019s awfully difficult to reconcile a supposed labor shortage with increases in automation with folks bitching about losing jobs to immigration.\n\nSomething does not add up.\n\nBut the reality of course is this: one person monitoring a half-dozen automated cashiers, vs a half dozen real life cashiers. The machines don\u2019t need medical benefits or competitive salary. The moment the dollar amount of *shrink* is made up for by the labor/benefit savings, of course the automation replaces the humans.\n\nThe other half of that reality: when Jane cannot work as a cashier at the market, her job prospects are bleak. If she and all like her can no longer afford to come in to purchase food, the market goes out of business. Automating people out of jobs ultimately comes back to bite the economy on the ass.\n\nThe automation wave is just getting into *hockey stick graph* territory. At some point in the forthcoming decade or so, a universal basic income is going to become a necessity.",

If you think landlords won't just raise rent by $900, you haven't been paying attention.\n\nAreas of society like housing and rent are already dysfunctional and require their own solutions regardless of whether we implement UBI. Many UBI advocates acknowledge that UBI would likely have to be implemented in conjunction with a temporary nationwide rent freeze as an example. But it's not true to say that UBI would lead to inflation across the board as a rule.\n\nPrinting money is typically what would cause inflation and modern UBI proposals don't involve printing money. UBI is *redistributive* in nature. Generally, consumer price sensitivity and competition keep prices reasonable and stable. It's the same reason why prices don't increase when minimum wage goes up. People won't wake up one day and be perfectly fine with paying $8.00 more for a burger at a restaurant. Even if every restaurant raised their prices at the same time, it only takes one of them to not do that to absorb much of the business and outcompete their competition.\n\nAdditionally, increasing the buying power of the middle class through UBI would increase the velocity of money within the economy and have a *deflationary* effect. What this means is that money is moving to where it is useful faster rather than being stagnant and not moving. In the US economy, money velocity is the lowest it's ever been and has been continually trending downward for decades. This points to economically unhealthy *underconsumption*. This is a big problem given how 70% of the US economy is driven by consumer spending.",

                                    "body": "I'm glad someone brought up the \"competition\" angle. I didn't want to make my original post too long, but I'll address this here sure. Basically, you're coming at it from the Yang angle.\n\nTo your first point, a temporary nationwide rent freeze is probably less likely to be passed by congress than a UBI in the first place. And even if it did, it doesn't change the long term problem.\n\nThe key flaw in the \"competition\" idea is that, at least in the US, competition doesn't really exist anymore. Let's take housing for example. Despite the Fed's ever-increasing interest rates making buying a home less attractive, prices haven't moved much. Care to guess why? It's because, in areas where people actually want to live (this is key), the supply of housing is ridiculously small compared to the number of people who want to buy. Ironically, this is only fueled by the ever-increasing cost of rent due to landlord greed. Apartments are in a similar situation. Because of a combination of restrictive zoning, NIMBY-ism, and lack of materials, not much new housing is being built. Either apartments or single family homes.\n\nSo the whole idea that \"if UBI happens and landlords raise rent, there will be some that don't and this competition will drive prices down\" is fundamentally flawed. There simply aren't that many vacancies for it to make sense in attractive areas. It's hard to say \"fine, I'll just go elsewhere,\" when elsewhere doesn't exist. And it also assumes landlords don't just collude, which they totally do lol. A temporary rent freeze only kicks the can down the road. Eventually, landlords would just stop renting out apartments out of spite, or demand more rent under the table under penalty of being kicked out. Because most landlords are inherently shitty people.\n\nSame thing can be said with food suppliers. Most food companies have monopolies or near-monopolies because the government hasn't done any real trust busting in 40 years. Under UBI, some companies could raise prices 200% or 300% and you'd be forced to pay because nobody else supplies it anymore. I'm guessing these costs would find their way into fast food prices as well. And even if they didn't, who wants to eat at restaurants / fast food every meal?\n\nFinally, your whole point about redistribution and the velocity of money only makes sense if you're talking about taxing the rich. Which obviously should happen, but good luck with that. The middle class / poor are already spending money as quickly as they're getting it. Savings are at an all time low. Only the rich are hoarding their wealth and slowing down the velocity.\n\nI guess, kinda circling back to my original point, what I'm trying to say is that I don't think there's a way for free market capitalism to exist alongside a heavily automated society. The amount of controls necessary to ensure most of the population doesn't just die in a ditch would basically necessitate a socialist or even communist system. And if you think the rich are going to just willingly give up their way of life because it's the right thing to do, you're in for a rude awakening in a few decades.",

I'm relatively young and I highly doubt I'll see the end of capitalism before I die. We didn't even get to the bandaid stage yet where they implement half measures to appease and control people, which will certainly buy them years and years to continue to hang on to their grotesque wealth and power. \n\nI also just don't really believe that when capitalism does finally collapse, however and whenever it does, that humans will suddenly decide to do the right thing. Really Capitalism only exists because people want it to. A (very) large portion of the population will do **anything** as long as it benefits them, as long as they have more. \n\nTl;dr Star Trek was a lie lol!",

Something that people get wrong about Marxism is that it's based on altruism n stuff. While reality couldn't be any more different. An axiom of Marxism and classical economics is that people are primarily selfish and interested in their own material outcome. That is what will bring socialism, not altruism but self interest.\n\nAlso, due to the falling rate of profit, only groups/nations of humans who use socialism will have economic growth, which would force or inspire others to do the same.",

Thus, the poor and middle class have gained no ground, and we all experience massive inflation. \n\nCompetition does not really exist in attractive areas to live in for the housing market because there are so few homes / apartments available compared to the number of those seeking them, and more cannot easily be built due to various factors.\n\nWith food and consumer goods, many companies are monopolies or nearly monopolies. They can raise prices because they're already eliminated the competition, and the government hasn't trust busted in decades. It is theoretically possible to disrupt these industries, but you'd need massive capital to get off the ground and that assumes they won't use underhanded tactics to drive you out of business. There's a reason most small businesses fail nowadays.\n\nUltimately, wealth inequality isn't something that can be fixed by printing more money, unless the government is willing to set hard caps on the prices of pretty much everything. Capitalism can't really work in a world where most of the world is automated and regular people have no means of earning a living. UBI is a pipedream of a bandaid that just tries to kick the can down the road instead of facing this ultimate truth.",

Are you suggesting taxing the wealthy? I mean, that's not even a UBI position lol. And good luck with that.\n\nIt's impossible. Swiss bank accounts. Offshore accounts. Cayman island accounts. There are all sorts of creative ways to hide your money that make it very difficult for the government to determine your total wealth. Including property in the calculation would help, but so much of the ulta-wealthy's wealth is tied up in stocks that it wouldn't amount to much.\n\nIt's VERY tricky to tax stock wealth. That's why only dividends are taxed, and not the entire value of your portfolio. If they tried to tax based on total portfolio value, people would just manipulate the share price at the time of assessment to pay as little as possible. Unless you were to take the average share value across the entire year, but we're really getting into the weeds here.\n\nAnd even IF you accomplish all of this and implement a UBI from the taxed wealth, my original point stands. Landlords and certain essential goods suppliers will just raise the rent to match the increased income, and the middle class / poor effectively have the same amount of income they started with. All you've done is make the landlords and corporate monopolies richer and siphoned some wealth away from investment bankers and CEOs not in those industries profiting from charging people more for what they need to live.\n\nIf your goal is to actually redistribute wealth, you need to cap the prices of key goods (like food) and rent.\n\nEDIT: Thought more about it. I suppose you're more talking about totally unemployed people living off of UBI, so they can move wherever. UBI would have to be a pretty significant portion of total wealth to pull that off. \n\nAnd sure, in theory, moving to less desirable areas where there are more open houses / apartments available would foster competition and help keep landlords from just charging the absolute maximum, but there's a reason beyond work that most people don't live too far outside of major cities.\n\nMost people don't wanna move away from their friends and family. As someone who did that for 4 years to further their career, it's fucking miserable. I've turned down offers 20, 30K more than what I'm making now, because I don't want to have to relocate to another state again.\n\nI'd much rather see a future where the government stepped in and converted a lot of unused urban space into high density free housing than a future where we have our current shitty systems, but only half the population works and the half that doesn't is forced to move out to bumblefuck nowhere because rent is too expensive in places people want to live.",

If everything goes up 10x, then taxes roughly go up 10x. It's possible to make UBI inflation-adjusted. Most welfare for the lower class does not lead to rampant inflation (unlike, say corporate handouts).\nI've proposed one potential scheme (0.1% wealth tax), but other schemes can be used.\n\nP.S. The number 0.1% is likely too low. I think that the total wealth tax that's used for everything (not just UBI should be ~1% with UBI funded by a certain share of that. \n\nOh, and I forgot to say that in my opinion the UBI should replace most welfare and the wealth tax should replace almost all other taxes. \n\n>All you've talked about is \".1% of total property / wealth\".\n>Are you suggesting taxing the wealthy?\n\nI'm suggesting taxing everyone. Every year the state takes 0.1% of what everyone has and evenly redistributes the total amount among everyone.\n\nIf all people have same wealth, the net flow is 0. When wealth inequality exists, it's slowly redistributed towards equal wealth.\n\n>It's VERY tricky to tax stock wealth.\nThe current stock taxes are much more compkex. \n>Unless you were to take the average share value across the entire year \n\nAlmost, but not exactly: In short, every day the bank/broker needs to record the total value of the stock the person owns (they can buy/sell stock) and average this over the year. This information is really easy to get for the brokers. Averaging somewhat simulates paying stock tax daily.\n\n>only dividends are taxed \n\nI think this is not a correct way to tax the stock. And the rich people know that. Lots of stocks do not pay dividends. Rich people pay 0 taxes for them. They do not sell the stock eithef. They borrow against that stock using it's value as collateral. Let's tax that money-making value.\nI also think that income tax is likely incorrect way of taxation which enables exponential accumulation of wealth. Wealth tax prevents that. \n\n>Landlords and certain essential goods suppliers will just raise the rent to match the increased income \n\nThe absolute prices do not matter. Think about this as follows: The landlords pay 0.1% of their real estate which is redistributed between all people including the renters. There are no dollars here. Just fractions of a house. House that brings in 2x rent costs 2x as much and is taxed 2x as much increasing the landlord-derived share of the UBI pool 2x. Things remain the same. \n\n>need to cap the prices of key goods \n\nI do not think capoing prices is a good idea.\n\n>totally unemployed people living off of UBI \n\nI think that UBI needs to be livable.\nThere is a spectrum of unemployment there... People might be learning new skilks for work, preparing to start a business, writing a novel etc.\n\n>Most people don't wanna move away from their friends and family. \n\nI understand this. And I think that UBI and acceptance of remote work can make this better. Imagine not needing to choose between staying with your friends and family and being able to make liveable wages. I hope that UBI will bring us much closer to this. \n\n>only half the population works and the half that doesn't is forced to move out to bumblefuck nowhere because rent is too expensive in places people want to live \n\nWith the current system everyone has to work (no time for health, education, skills), but still need to live in bumblefucks.\n\n>converted a lot of unused urban space into high density free housing \n\nThis can be a good idea as well. Although those places would probably be not the nicest ones.",

It\u2019s much easier and cost less to make a human than to make a humanoid robot.\n\nYes, Honda worked on Asimov and now Tesla is working on its own implementation, but for now, human labour is cheaper than full fledged humanoid robots.\n\nSecond, awareness. Humans have a sens of awareness that no machine has today. Again, this will change in the incoming years and it might even cost less to rent that type of artificial awareness Than to employ a human.\n\nBut the first point is still valid. Electro mechanical parts deteriorate and/or break over time, compared to software that it doesn\u2019t break if you don\u2019t touch it.\n\nSo, it\u2019s not yet clear to me how all of this is going to pan out. But I think, and I might be wrong, sophisticated anthropomorphic machines might be costly in both acquisition and maintenance.\n\nSo it begs the question, why do we bother with humanoid robots if at some point they might cost not as much as human labor but more than what we thought it was going to cost.\n\nJust think of cars! Yes, electric ones might have less maintenance than combustion one, but they still degrade and still need to be inspected for safety.\n\nI think, now, we might be having humanoid robots akin to a Ford model T. So we\u2019re not that close to an equivalent robot of an electric car.",

And the capital expenditure needed for automation acts as a barrier to entry, and makes it more difficult for smaller players to compete.  This is true at every point along the technological gradient, and is not particular to automation.  The increasing cost of war partially drove the centralization of power and the development of the nation-state.   Tribes of dudes with pointy sticks can't go up against organized armies with armor and artillery.  Which takes capital, and concentrates power.   At each iteration of technological advance, the gap between the poorer groups with the pointy sticks and the group with the aircraft carriers (the US has eleven!) grows more difficult to overcome.   \n\nBut that also entrenches the need for training and education.  Which is just another type of arms race.   Workers have to compete in an economy that needs ever-increasing specialized expertise.   Which makes them vulnerable to opportunity costs (what else could I have studied?) and path dependence (the skill you learned went out of fashion).",
