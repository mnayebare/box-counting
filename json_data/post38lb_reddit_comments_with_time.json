Don't forget, we're the weirdos.\n\nTake a normal person, and say hey, I can disable the telematics systems in your car which will give you more privacy, you won't be able to start it with the app, won't be able to play with climate control from inside your warm or cool house, won't be able to use your phone as a key,  won't be able to view your oil life, won't be reminded of service needed automatically, won't be able to click a button to schedule a service that will already know what needs to be done and just spit out a date for you, won't be able to send a tow truck to that unknown location in the middle of nowhere that you can't explain...the list goes on. Good luck convincing normal people of that.\n\nPeople WANT this stuff. It's going to keep coming. Our best hope is to keep stuff as privacy respecting as humanly possible, but we're not stopping the progression, thinking we can is delusional. \n\nThose staff-less Amazon stores have already started how retail is going to end, tell a mother with a bunch of kids she can walk into a supermarket, and through whatever method have her identity known, can just load up a cart and walk back out the door, no lines, no cashier, just walk out. That IS going to happen, it's already started. The overwhelming majority use store rewards cards, linked their banks to them, they already know who they are and what they're buying, and that's how people will view it, skipping the worst step in the process which is the line and cashier. Nobody is fighting that, half the privacy advocates won't even fight it, who we kidding?\n\nSome of this stuff is working FOR us as well. I have a handful of store apps, linked to bullshit names, blowoff phone numbers, made up PO Boxes, and linked to masked cards that will work with any info or ZIP code used. I get the benefit, and they don't know anything that's real, works at the gaspumps as well. That will change and it won't be that easy, but there's always ways to push back. It's a cat and mouse game.",
