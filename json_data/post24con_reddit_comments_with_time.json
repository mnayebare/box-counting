Now the question is, how are we comfortable using this technology if we know this?\n\nIf you\u2019re not bothered by it\u2014imagine it was flipped. What if this technology more frequently misidentified white people (or whatever ethnic group you belong to)? Would you be okay with this being used to draw police attention to you or to convict you in court?",

No one is proposing to use facial recognition software to replace the jury in a criminal court of law. What facial recognition software does is to raise a flag to investigate something. \n\n> What if this technology more frequently misidentified white people\n\nThat's not the question to ask. What really matters is if this technology is better or worse than humans doing the same job. We use chainsaws and forklifts because they do a job better than humans; that's how we pick every tool we use. If it's worse than a human we don't use that tool.\n\nThe right metric to use is to compare the results to what is used today, which is often a generic description. How many people will be wrongly identified by a facial recognition software, compared to a description of \"black male about 20 years old wearing jeans and a gray hoodie\".\n\nThere have been many cases of people who were killed after being misidentified by police officers. One case was so notorious that [Bruce Springsteen made a song about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQMqWAiWPMs).",

If you were paying attention in high school science you\u2019ll remember light colors reflect more light dark colors absorb more light.\n\nIf someone has light colored skin more information is reflected back to the computer, if a person has dark colored skin less information is reflected back. The more information the computer has to work with the more accurate it can be about recognizing someone. Less information means the computer is going to be less accurate at recognizing someone.\n\nFacial recognition will always be more accurate on lighter skinned people because more reflected light means more data which allows the software to more accurately make a match.\n\nIt\u2019s not racist software or programmers, it\u2019s not sample data being too white, it\u2019s not a bias unconsciously baked in, it\u2019s just less reflected light.",

We use those to get things done. It is not \"Racially discriminatory\", the laws of physics is not unjust or prejudiced. It is just itself.\n\nSay that Police runs after people right? are criminals that happens to not be able to run good counts as \"Discrimination\" ? Then we should stop having police entirely?\n\nRailing about any differences whatsoever is so counterproductive. People will be treated differently because of a million different variable in life. Live with it.\n\nFacial recognition system is a way forward for law enforcement. It existing is better than nothing which is what the other option is. Would you really rather hand over the task to actually racist humans prone to error of judgement and prejudice?\n\nAutomation no matter how flawed inevitably gets ahead because humans no matter how adaptable are full of imperfections and cannot be expected to perform consistently close to 100% perfection in a single task. Not to mention there are actually evil and horrid humans existing out there. Even if AI could perform badly, we can still expect it to do better than a human eventually with enough development.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHaving facial recognition is better than nothing.",
