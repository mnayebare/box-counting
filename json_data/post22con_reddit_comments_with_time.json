IOW, in the social sciences they make their conclusion first and then go run tests that agree with the predetermined conclusion.\n\nIn brief, in the social \"sciences\", you can find a published study that agrees with any viewpoint you want.\n\nIf you think you can trust the conclusions of social science publications, I have a bridge to sell you.",

Nobody serious is interviewing two candidates and picking a vastly inferior one due to DEI.\n\nThe article I've linked, which is just one example of what we have all seen happen across hundreds os companies during the last decade or so, says:\n> We try hard, but again find ourselves with a 98% male candidate pool. You should know that we are an early stage startup that cannot afford market salaries. Despite that, we paid premium salaries to bring a few women who did well in our interviews. But, they lacked the energy to put us into overdrive. Worse, they were starting to drain the energy from the rest of the team. Eventually, we had to do the right thing for the company and let them go. I\u2019m now back to being the only woman on the (tech) team.\n>\n> [...]\n>\n> After diversity attempts at large companies and my own startup and the attempts to start tech early with my own children, I can tell you that our obsession with diversity and attempts to solve it are only fucking it up for the actual women in tech out there!\n> \n> What do I mean by this?\n>\n> * We get upset about the state of gender diversity in tech\n> * We make a pact to hire more women\n> * The pool has (a lot) more men than women\n> * After some rounds of low to no success, we start to compromise and hire women just because we have to\n> * These women show up at work and perform not as great as we want them to\n> * It reinforces to the male population that was already peeved by the diversity push that women aren\u2019t that good at tech after all\n> * They generalize that observation on the entire women in tech community\n> * Sooner or later, some such opinions get out there\n> * The feminists amongst us go crazy\n> * The diversity advocates are caught in a frenzy and make a pact to hire more women (again)\n> * This loops. Infinitely.\n\nIf you've personally never seen any instances of this happening, then congrats, maybe you got lucky. I've not only had to work with new hires that were just filling a quota and were clearly not up to the task. I also personally listened to my own manager vent to me on a late Friday evening because he just got off the phone with HR and they were pretty much forcing him to pick the only female candidate that showed up, instead of his preferred (male) candidate with an impressive CV, multinational experience and fluidity in the two languages we needed.\n\nWhenever a company is applying gender/diversity quotas in their HR policy, they're discriminating someone in favour or someone else. There's simply no way around that. You may never get to see the guy that was not hired, and he may not even know why he wasn't hired. But someone had to be discriminated against if somebody else was hired to meet a quota. Otherwise there wouldn't be any need for quotas in the first place, because the \"diverse\" candidate would be hired naturally.",

If you *can't even tell* whether or not you're leaving casualties in your wake, it's a bit disingenuous to claim that there are no casualties and that, even if there were, you aren't going to look for any!\n\n> Nobody who is unqualified is getting hired. Nobody who is good at their job cares.\n\nI've been in this business now for 25+ years. IMHO, both those statements above are wrong.\n\n*Sometimes* an underqualified candidate slipped through on the DEI card at the expense of a *very slightly* more qualified candidate.\n\nMaking the claim that the DEI initiatives never made a mistake is, in itself, an extraordinary claim and thus requires extraordinary evidence. Top-down edicts are not famous for being correct.\n\nThis \"trust me, bro\" approach to what was in fact and in effect a top-down edict did not engender confidence amongst the mere mortals.",

You currently are. You're the advocate, you provide the data.\n\nWhat **I did** was to ask \"how would one construct a test to test your claim\". In that post I didn't even ask for results of that test, I was wondering how one would test your claim.\n\nThat's the whole point - if you're shying away from any falsifiability then that's fine, too, at least then we both know that (as of writing) we cannot devise a test.\n\n> This is a non-issue, designed to be inflammatory and stop people talking about what actually matters.\n\nI agree with this. But I also agree with the assertion that the original DEI enforcements and edicts were *also* designed to stop the masses thinking about what actually matters.\n\nThey appeared to have achieved very little, but still appeared to have played a small but significant factor in getting Trump elected, and these DEI policies being dismantled is no doubt still playing a part in his continued support.\n\nI feel that if there was less outrage and oppression olympics in the previous 4-10 years, the US would not have seen a Trump presidency in 2025.",

The point is that the \"racism\" you complain about exist, just that you refuse to recognize it cause you don't think people's biases affect society and especially hiring in historically discriminated industries including engineering.\n\nFor a method that noone should have a problem with, I'd recommend reading up on equality in shortlisting and please let me know your opinion of it. In summary, it's ensuring recruitment shortlists have increased equality (in as many factors as possible), while ensuring that truly the best person is hired (which some people argue targeted recruitment doesn't).",

This has nothing to do with the values of our movement! This is about national patriotism and protectionism, and they will happily accept splitting our community on their way.",
