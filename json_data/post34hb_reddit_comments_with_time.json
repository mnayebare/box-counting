Immigration to the US over the last several decades has not been due to a labor shortage, but rather a desire by employers to pay a lower wage than Americans expect. So I would argue that even as AI destroys and replaces jobs there will still be immigrants who are willing and able to work for less money than Americans. Therefore, immigrants will continue to come on a large scale unless the government decides to stop it.",

Scandinavia is a common example. \n\nThe second is that nations with massive amounts of lower class (often immigrants) that can be used for resource extraction are positioned really well because they will continue to feed the nations building/using AI with raw materials. Russia and India are common examples. \n\nAnyone not in one of these categories is basically just fucked because they can\u2019t afford to use the mythical \u201cfuture AI\u201d or meaningfully contribute to its manufacturing lifecycle. \n\nThe U.S. & China seems to be trying to position to be both. It wants a massive influx of lower class for resource extraction and labor, but also wants to cultivate best-in-class engineers to create and use the AI. This is basically what the US looked like in the Gilded Age and helped them to soar past other nations in power, wealth, and status. At the expense of millions of people of course. \n\nThis is all assuming BigTech\u2019s optimistic vision of AI comes true. We\u2019ve seen massive improvements over the past few years and it\u2019s truly wild what it can do. But we\u2019re not at all at the point AI straight up replaces human employees and there\u2019s not a guarantee we\u2019ll ever get there. They really, really want to though.",

But it isnt going to take too long for humans to \"get good as using AI\". As we keep getting better and better at it we're going to find its limits and its exactly at those limits where the demand will eventually settle. When the computer was first  gaining popularity in homes people thought exactly the same thing, that it would replace millions of jobs and it did, at least the kinds of jobs that were around at that time. But people became good at using computers, they found their limits and that is were the demand settled and ended up creating millions and millions of new jobs. For instance what do we consider to be a \"good website\"? Well its exactly the kind of website that maximizes the potential of a computer and the potential of a team of people good at using those computers. This has always been true. A good product and service maximizes the tools and technology available at the time and a group of humans who have specialized skill with those tools. The standard is incredibly arbitrary but the conditions are very specific.",

It's reminiscent of maslow's conjoined triangles of needs:\n\nInitially, societies were entirely centered on food production, and that is what 90% of jobs were. As technology and techniques improved, it allowed people to value other things and other jobs developed from those needs.\n\nWith the industrialization of society, people were freed up to find new things that people would pay for. A couple of examples, the milkman and wallpaper manufacturing both began about 250 years ago, because society as a whole had more money and a surplus of workers. Suddenly there were people available to deliver milk, and customers with the money to pay for it appearing on their doorsteps.\n\nSimilarly, with electronics many systems became automated, and therefore cheaper, again enriching society, and again new jobs appeared as people found they had the time and the customers that previously didn't exist. Two examples that spring to mind are physiotherapy (and all the various specialists in healthcare) and teachers. These are both areas which have seen large increases in employment in the twentieth century.\n\nSo again, a new automatic will arise, again, it will make current needs cheaper, and free up a new workforce to take on roles we currently don't consider worth our small wealth. The lessons of history are that this happens, and that we can't see what it will look like from this side.",

By design, management in most sizable corporations aren't domain experts, but generalists whose main job is to provide human leadership/direction to a human workforce and to accept accountability for (and provide to shareholders explanations of) the failures or successes of the corporations they head. One minute reading through the 5000 inspirational leadership posts on a LinkedIn feed should be enough to reinforce the point that management jobs are social - not technical - roles.\n\nWhat ML could replace (or significantly alter) are menial jobs that involve low levels of fiscal responsibility and don't require physical labor or extensive social interaction. In the bigger picture, it will allow humans to focus on higher level tasks by taking on lower level ones, essentially becoming a sort of 'force multiplier' for human productivity. \n\nThis is no different than the societal changes that occurred following previous technological developments in history. The roles of scribes, plowmen, telephone operators, message couriers, etc. have been rendered obsolete by technology, and the labor surplus created by this has allowed humans to focus on other things that they were unable to do in scale before.",

Let me explain, in brief.\n\nMy core assertions will revolve around a) whether we 'need' **immigration** or not, and b) the impact of AI on the **labor market**.\n\nWe don't \"need\" immigration except to avoid economic decline & geopolitical irrelevance.\n\nJapan has only recently embraced immigration--far too late, but better late than never. They seemed to be resigned to economic decline to eventual middle-income per capita status & eventual geopolitical irrelevance (though for now they have an impressive navy & brilliant geostrategic ingratiation with the US).\n\nAnyway, the predictions of labor collapse go as far back as printing presses & yarn looms & even more recently to computers. The predictions have all been wrong. AI will expand economies, accelerate innovation, & re-prioritize the focus of labor vs automation.\n\nNot only will AI not replace many manual & service-sector jobs, they won't even replace white-collar jobs (in the aggregate). They merely shift the labor that is prioritized for relatively costly humans to work on. And to reiterate, AI will aid in the generation of new ideas & new innovation.\n\n**To summarize**, whether a nation-state \"needs\" immigration depends on their long-term national strategy & internal politics; and AI will not dramatically eliminate jobs in the aggregate, but re-prioritize what humans (vs machines) should do whilst driving aggregate economic growth & innovation.",

One designer could do in a week what once took an entire team three months. And yet, employment in my sector has been steady. Clients just now expect to get a design in six weeks instead of two years, and they plan accordingly. Engineering needs are mostly driven by marketing projections, so all that has happened is the projections don't have to go out as far, and are thus more accurate. Everyone is still just as busy as before. Since design was made cheaper by CAD software, clients do a lot more design.",

I mean, people move to different states to go somewhere with legal weed, or abortion access, or whatever. \n\nI thought you were espousing a sort of \"right of freedom of movement\" philosophy, and I was agreeing with that. The most common critique of immigrants is that they're taking jobs, but if AI takes jobs instead, then what's the reason for telling people they can't immigrate?\n\nThen, since the overall topic of discussion was AI, and I was mentioning how AI relates to leaving people in economic distress if they can't find jobs, I wanted to state my main concern with, like, the economy as a whole. It's not that AI or immigrants or whatever are taking jobs; it's that we have a society that allows for unethical wealth concentration, instead of building systems to distribute wealth to foster shared well-being.\n\nThe long-term ideal for human society is for us all to enjoy a life of self-actualization, leisure, and pursuit of whatever knowledge or creativity or exploration we find rewarding. Let the machines toil for us, and have the government distribute the profits among everyone. Work can be optional for most humans. And when it is, the only limit to immigration ought to be that some property might be expensive, so you'd have to do something valuable to be able to afford it.",

We still need immigrant labor today and actually don\u2019t have enough of it despite massive waves of newcomers here. \n\nAI will absolutely change things, but it will not eliminate the need for human labor. It\u2019s naive at best to believe we should completely stop immigration today because an unproven prospective technology is going eventually take everyone\u2019s jobs. When and if that day comes, they\u2019ll stop coming because they\u2019re no longer in demand. That\u2019s how capitalism works. Not the other way around.",

New industries will be created, new demand for human capital will be created, and we need to ensure that human resources meet the demand that is to come (not the one that has been). Over the course of my working lifetime I have seen the dislocation of low-skills, low-information workers in the auto industry, the mining industry, the forest/sawmill industry, the agricultural/food processing industries, and the shipping industry. Next up is the aircraft manufacturing industry (Boeing is arguing that it is more machines that are going to solve its quality-control issues on the shop floor, and while they are on something of a quiet hiring binge they aren't hiring back \"Rosie the Riveter\").\n\nMy point in this discussion is that with the ongoing advances in AI/robotics, we need to devote resources into ensuring that our present workforce is able to adapt to new and evolving industries, and that we need to devote attention to an immigration policy that complements the demands of new and evolving industries. I just don't think that any of that is radical or unreasonable (I do think that those who argue that it is not an issue are creating a recipe for disaster).",

This approach aims to ensure that the financial benefits of automation are redistributed to support public welfare and mitigate the negative impacts of job losses due to automation [oai_citation:1,Nordic model - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model) [oai_citation:2,Scandinavian 'Socialism': The Truth of the Nordic Model - Life in Norway](https://www.lifeinnorway.net/scandinavian-socialism/).\n\nThis model aligns with the broader principles of the Nordic economic model, which emphasizes social equity, strong welfare states, and collective ownership to support a more inclusive economy. By linking company ownership to automation levels, this model seeks to create a more equitable distribution of wealth generated by technological advancements.\n\nFrom Gpt4o",

Multimodality doesn't fix the issue you're talking about; all it is, is just glorified systems with multiple models in-between steps.

AI art is boring and emotionless.\n\nYou already see it with the AI art that exists. It's cool, but people don't care or connect with it. It's great for replacing stock images. But no one cares about AI from an art perspective. They want the human connection.\n\nIf personalities didn't matter in music for example, then artists wouldn't be pushed to show their face, story, emotional connection, and meaning in songs. They would just pump out faceless and nameless bangers.\n\nYet here we are, people love Taylor Swift's music, because it's Taylor Swift's face on it. Not because it sounds good.",

And yes, Taylor Swift will be rich controlling the Taylor Swift brand, but the thing you really have to think about is, what when you can talk to her whenever you want, when she can write songs for you and your friends guiding your life, will that be a more popular product? I\u2019m sure it will. The reality is none of us actually knows Taylor Swift. We know a representation. When artists can control that representation but make it more interactive, I think they will, and that opens the door to the rest.\n\nI think we are actually going to have to change how our civilization is structured around AGI.",

Farms, factories, ect.  But it turns out, the market will make use of available manpower somehow, even if one job type or another becomes less necessary.  So no, AI is not going to result in a massive unemployment crisis.  \n\nYou seem to fundamentally misunderstand how previous transitions took place.  Manufacturing wasn't a thriving sector just waiting when people came in off the farms.  It was the reverse, as employment went down, manufacturing took advantage of that labor capital to expand and become a titanic industry.  The same thing will happen again.  There might be some temporary growing pains, but there is not going to be some massive, lasting deficit of available jobs.",
