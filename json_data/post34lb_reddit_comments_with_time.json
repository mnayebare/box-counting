Religion can be a good way of collating these under one banner, and need not involve belief in anything. Just because the Xian view of religion says that one must believe in order to be a member, doesn't make it true for all religions, or all cultures. Look at the Jewish saying \"My neighbour goes to the synagogue to talk to G-d, I go to the synagogue to talk to my neighbour.\"\n\nThat said, I think that because most of the leading AI creators come from culturally Xian nations/cultures, the Xian view of religion would be the primary one, and so I'd be leery of it until it's shown to be otherwise. We've already got a few violently universalising religions, we don't need to create more.",

            "body": "I'll admit some of my beliefs come somewhat close to religion in a strange way. I'm agnostic, leaning towards atheism. My best guess regarding what happens after death is a state of oblivion, a simple ending of consciousness: an idea that utterly terrifies me. I think the only way we could prevent such an ending is through the use of technology.\n\nI also think the idea of a technological singularity makes a lot of sense. While I imagine most people here are familiar with the term, I'll summarize briefly. Essentially once human level AI is developed, it will be able to refine and improve itself (or design better AI) just as fast as we could, working tirelessly without requiring food and sleep, being unburdened by a biological brain's processing power and working memory, and not having the need to slowly educate scientists working on the project. Each successive evolution will lead to even faster advancement. The idea of the singularity basically states once we have human level AI, it will improve exponentially, and very quickly, until we have near god level AI.\n\nIf this actually occurs in a situation in which we're able to avoid the AI apocalypse and have the extremely powerful AI be benevolent, it will almost certainly be able to help humans achieve radical life extension through mind uploading, biological interventions, nanobots, or even some technology we haven't even conceptualized yet. An extremely powerful and benevolent AI would also be able to come up with solutions to a variety of problems humanity faces. It could help us rapidly become an extremely advanced society.\n\nSo while I don't personally consider myself religious regarding AI, I get it. I don't think the idea of a singularity is that far fetched especially compared with all the contemporary and historical religious beliefs. And if you think the singularity is coming and there's even a chance of it being a positive event, it's not hard to imagine it as somewhat of a robot messiah offering eternal life and a utopian society. Is it really that crazy to cope with fear of death by hoping for a future in which we can beat it through technology in a society where others believe in afterlives and reincarnation?",

For something to be the originator of the universe and most powerful being they would need to be outside of or unrestrained by the universe. \n\nMy evidence that Yahweh exists would probably be the 3 million witnesses who heard him speak to them at mount Sinai. Then I would say the 500 witnesses of Christ's resurrected being and their own martyrdom. And if you're being martyred you must believe whatever it is you're dying for.",

Billions were children, who knew nothing of the world and only suffered for their brief life before they were forgotten.",
