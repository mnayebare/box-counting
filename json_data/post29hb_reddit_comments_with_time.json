They have always seen labor as just another machine to rent. Or livestock to borrow to plow the fields, so to speak.  \nIt isn't a coincidence that capital funneled heinous amounts of money into AI and continues to do so.  \nOne big upfront investment and then they can eliminate untold amounts of those pesky farm animals draining extra resources that could better be served sitting in their offshore accounts than actually serving society.   \nThis is what they want. This is what they have always wanted. They want to pay a skeleton crew just enough to keep their automated tech running at the lowest cost possible.  \nAnd they do not care if their old farm machinery rots. They do not care if we starve or die.   \nAs far as they are concerned, we are the have nots.

Instead you want people to have to demonstrate value by being \"real, having presence, care, creativity, and coherence?\" That kind of sounds like a bunch of influencers having to compete for money and resources in some sick competition to show value through human authenticity. That sounds like it could be a lot worse than what we have now. If the problems of scarcity and economic productivity are solved, and everyone can have all their needs met for free, why the hell would you want to introduce a new alternative system for creating scarcity by making people compete for resources do little monkey dances to prove their authentically human value. Maybe you are trying to say that we need a shift in values just culturally, but the fact that you say UBI is a bandaid and that we need to replace the labor system instead really makes it sound like you want a new vibes based theory of value to create scarcity, and to make people dance to prove their human value in some economically non-productive way.",

The old 80/20 rule still applies\u2014 in most companies, 20% of the staff create 80% of the value. That doesn't mean the rest aren't working; it's purely value-based. And the larger the company, the smaller that productive portion tends to become.\n\nThe only thing I'm still a bit *hurt* by is how suddenly it became *\"okay\"* to just steal IP from people. I've invested a lot of time\u2014at a high level\u2014integrating intelligence into production processes and creating automation.\n\nAnd these *\"new\"* AI models? Honestly, I don't see much that's truly new. Sure, the logic has improved, but it's still just machine learning\u2014supercharged with much larger datasets.\n\nThe same problem still applies: an AI learning from another AI will, over time, degenerate the data. It won't really *evolve*.\n\nI remember over 20 years ago when all the accountants were told, *\"Hey, your jobs are gone.\"* I think we have more accountants today than we did then.\n\nAI/ML can do things, yes, and it *will* shift some labor from desk jobs back to physical jobs. That's just how development flows.\n\nI worked at a giant company where, day in and day out, I watched people\u2014even those in senior positions\u2014whose main task was to move data between ERP platforms and... Excel (yes, Excel), or from one Excel sheet to another. Yes, these people need a different kind of job. No doubt about that.\n\nAutomation in production might be a bit different. In mass production, you can automate to a high degree. But when it comes to mass customization, it's more complex. You *can* create designs based on features and populate them with data, thereby automating new designs in production environments (like CNC). Processes like metal printing also help.\n\nBut the cost\u2014especially of machinery for non-repetitive tasks\u2014is still far too high. It's often much easier to just hire a person.\n\nMy hope still lies with the EU Transparency Act. We need *actual*, *clear* models showing how AI generated a solution to be part of any delivery. That kind of requirement would shut down a lot of the data abuse happening with LLMs.",

I see a lot of the other sort of redundancy, the one where companies hoard talent and take on staff because recruitment is not controlled or is optimistic as a proxy for success. Then people sit around with 'make work', useless meetings and taking ages on simple stuff so that there's stuff to do after lunch. The people who are tech savvy are already automating their work and taking the afternoon off (quietly at home in their living room with a box set or a video game)",

My role, as the technical lead, was to ensure everything was going according to plan.\n\nNormally, the reporting aspect of this role is massive. You have a CTO who wants to stay on top of expensive projects, along with layers of management constantly asking for updates. Many people in the same role as me spent a huge amount of time just reporting and filling in documentation.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a lazy streak (and this was quite a while ago), so I created a standardized reporting setup using simple spreadsheets. I built an automated Excel system (this was back in the day\u2014Excel was what I had) that gathered all the reporting data and converted it into a leadership-ready report. This allowed me to complete in 10 minutes what others spent 20\u201340 hours a month on\u2014provided project managers used the template. (i could have 30+ PM\u00b4s reporting to me)\n\nThis left me time to actually dive deep and ensure the reports reflected reality, not just \"visual bullshit.\"\n\nEven 15+ years ago, it was amazing what a little knowledge of Excel or basic databases could achieve. And when I look at companies today\u2014yes, some have begun to implement AI and ML\u2014but I\u2019ve yet to see a company that truly understands the need to invest in a solid data foundation first.\n\nMost large companies have such poor data quality and discipline that it's just insane. So every time they try to automate, it fails. They fall back on the lowest form of automation\u2014RPA\u2014which requires just as much manpower to maintain in a changing environment as it saves in time. It\u2019s not built for long-term automation. It's simply not robust enough.\n\nwhat i often just then see, is that the \"data roadmap\" for these companies is to buy software, so it just creates more disturbance in the organization than actual value, because they have no idea how to use it.",

Perhaps people in power know that many of the jobs that we currently have are going to be replaced by AI, and then perhaps factory jobs and different types of manual labor May have to be options for more people going forward.

Considering the amount of Ai-generated content and that this content becomes harder and harder to distinguish I think there's a real possibility of AIs hitting a certain \"wall\" of cleverness, limited by the amount of human-made content, after which they'll start degrading.\n\nPlus you can always \"poison\" AI with any sort of trash or noice(greatest example is Nightshade, used by artists to fight against illegal usage of their work for AI training).\n\nSo, I don't think AI is some magic thing that will be able to do jobs by itself. Yes, it'll help us with routine, brain-afk jobs, but it happened before in different spheres. AI is just an instrument that will further increase our productivity, probably leading to the next industrial revolution. Humanity somehow survived the previous 3 without societal collapse, so we'll survive fourth.",

After pivoting to AI, the company changed vacations to senior ML dev, and fired the metaverse dev to compensate. Who then had to find a job as server technician at an AI company\n\nThat's not what my example said. We previously had 3 companies that had 2 devs who worked on product development (enterprise solutions, websites, apps...). These devs aren't AI devs. If they converted to this field, they would be juniors, which means that they would have a hard time finding a job with the same salaries and benefits.",

Anyone who uses an LLM will hit these walls pretty quickly.\n\nIn the art space for example (speaking with a lot of experience in local image gen pipelines) , yes, you can generate a photo realistic image or video clip from thin air. But you very quickly realize you can't really art direct it, it can only produce a very narrow range of subjects, and even the control networks and such have clear limits.\n\nFor me the bright red flag though are the AI assistants. They're all terrible, and this is because they have limited ability to gather real world context or even device context. Eg, Gemini regularly fails to fast forward a podcast (What did you want to fast forward? I need X permission. I don't understand). These are solvable problems, but if this is what Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple are pushing out the door today, we're a ways from AI even replacing an admin assistant. \n\nPeople underestimate how sophisticated people are. You can conduct a phone call while manipulating a variety of objects in your hand while walking while eating while daydreaming. It's hard to get an AI or robot to do any one of those things competently, and people are actually pretty cheap.",

The point is that its model reflects structural dynamics similar to those of colonialism Specifically, economic extraction enabled by power imbalances.\n\nColonialism wasn\u2019t just about military occupation. It was about tapping into foreign labor and resources under unequal terms, where one side profited massively and the other remained dependent. Fiverr (and platforms like it) operate under a modern version of that: using global wage gaps and weak labor protections in developing countries to provide cheap labor for businesses in richer nations, without accountability to the workers or their local economies.\n\nJust because someone takes a job on Fiverr doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t being exploited. That logic \u201cthey chose it so it must be good for them\u201d, ignores structural coercion. When the alternatives are few or worse, \u201cchoice\u201d becomes a veneer for necessity.\n\nFiverr\u2019s model also helps employers in the U.S., EU, etc., sidestep things like minimum wage laws, worker protections, healthcare costs, and collective bargaining. That suppresses wages globally. Not just abroad, but also at home, because it creates a race to the bottom. It devalues creative, complex work by commodifying it.\n\nNone of this is meant to dismiss the value Fiverr might offer individual freelancers. But when viewed through the lens of history and global economics, the platform functions more like a digital extraction tool than a liberation engine. \n\nIt\u2019s not about nationality, it\u2019s about who owns the platform, who profits, and who carries the risk.\n\nThat\u2019s the parallel. Not flags and armies, but capital and labor rights. And that\u2019s worth calling out.",

Their models have value and free trade can raise global averages in theory. But those averages hide who actually benefits, and they rarely account for power imbalances or lived experience. That\u2019s where social scientists, labor researchers, and global development experts bring a different perspective. Many of them see platforms like Fiverr as systems that extract value from vulnerable workers while concentrating profit elsewhere.\n\nJust because a system increases economic activity does not mean it improves quality of life. A job that pays slightly more than nothing, offers no protections, and replaces stable work elsewhere is not a net positive for human well-being. The free trade model might benefit companies and show growth on paper, but that does not automatically translate into dignity, security, or opportunity for workers. My point isn\u2019t rooted in economic theory, it\u2019s rooted in a concern for how people actually live under these systems.",

What do you think makes you so special as that one person that the thing you're contributing is the thing that can't be replaced?\n\nIf we really end up being able to replace most jobs, then we're going to be able to replace every job. Human labor will have no value, if you didn't already have the wealth to not need to work, you're gonna SoL, on permanent minimum wage government \"UBI\" forced into compliance because they literally control your ability to survive.\n\nIt is definitely not a happy path.",

Hollywood right now makes around 150 major movies a year, that's small enough that you could still watch everything if you really wanted to. If AI turns that into 1500, you don't end up with a movie market 10x the size, since nobody got time to watch all of them.

It's like that across the board because your time+energy are limited. \n\nAlso, there's probably already some obscure economics textbook on this idea, but here's the problem from a different angle: the redundancy of products in a field scales faster than the utility/uniqueness of products as qty of competitors increases. It's not enough to be unique in just some minor way. You need to overcome inertia to get someone to drop a product they like to go to your product, so your product needs to be unique in a big way. That's not easy even for large companies.",

Like I knew what happened there but I feel like somebody who doesn't know the task would be confused by how quickly that went by. Overall, the pacing was the worst part.\n\nThe restrictions of the medium you use often strongly influence what the product is, and I think that it should be telling that you chose to make a film about an AI being trained with your AI trained tools. If you tried to make a short film that wasn't at least somewhat about AI, all the artifacting would be so out of place that it would ruin it entirely.\n\nI do want to say that I am glad I watched to the end. I actually think that this could be an interesting short film if it was made through traditional means, either live action or animation. I think there also needs to be a lot more clarity to the emotion of the conflict in the first part of the video",

There might still be talented individuals who can outperform machines or provide niche skills which machines have yet to adopt, but if you need to be remarkable to not be replaceable, many people will end up being replaceable.\n\nWhich may sound a bit harsh but so far as I'm aware it's the truth, and we can't afford to cover this truth up with a white lie, no matter how well-intentioned.",

The Kindle debuted almost 20 years ago, and physical books still outsell e-books by a huge margin (on a related note, pharma advertising\u2014which will live forever whether anyone likes it or not thanks to the 3rd biggest lobbby in the country\u2014still includes significant print production). My spouse works at a local library, and the self-service item-check-out device gathers dust. Barnes and Noble is opening more stores this year than they did last year or the year before. Vinyl sales are soaring 300% over the last eight years.\n\nIt's not that there won't be transformational change in industries from this technology, because, yes, it will be \"capable\", potentially/theoretically, of supplanting this task or that task. But that doesn't mean that \\*every\\* business and \\*every\\* industry will collectively agree that the theoretical cost savings are worth the risk of mistakes OR\u2014most importantly\u2014that consumers will seamlessly adapt to this revolutionary change in their engagement with products and services overnight. Certain audiences and industries are incredibly intransigent and resistant to technological change. Many CEOs have friends in every industry, I understand that, but there's a difference between having a diverse stock portfolio and having diverse experience. When someone who is an expert in AI \\*and\\* an experienced expert in medicine (you know, an actual doctor or chief of a hospital) expresses certainty that AI will displace millions of doctors, I'll believe them. When someone who is an expert in AI \\*and\\* an expert in the legal profession expresses certainty that AI will displace millions of lawyers, I'll believe them. In order for those predictions to come true, we would need more than just technological capabilities. We'd need behavioral change that you can't just force on people. We're far more complex a species than this tech that folks are saying is \"smarter\" than us would have us believe. That's before we get to the incredibly slim or nonexistent profit margins the companies making the models can generate. Google Ed Zitron's newsletter for more details on that.",

Unless your company runs completely on third party applications, there is still a huge implementation cost and risk.  I get pummeled with requests to automate everything, but when it comes down to cost, magically senior leaders lose interest.  So no, it\u2019s not coming for anyone\u2019s jobs at the rate the media makes it out to be.\n\n2) We have automated many \u201ceasy tasks\u201d and some that have replaced a person\u2019s job.  But guess what? We just reassigned said employee to a different more interesting role.  They don\u2019t have to be a \u201cmaster\u201d at what they do, given most of the things automated don\u2019t require that.  They just need to be reliable good employees.

Consider the early days of programming: some believed languages like C would enable almost anyone to code, potentially making then-current programmers irrelevant. Instead, the field evolved, and roles shifted.\n\nIt's similar to Jevons Paradox. If AI significantly boosts development efficiency, it might not shrink the job market, but could instead expand the demand for software. For instance, perhaps every restaurant will eventually have its own website and applications. \n\nGiven this, my advice to software engineers at any career stage (whether early, mid-level, or experienced) is to proactively learn and integrate AI. I've been experimenting myself; my attempt at 'vibe-coding,' for example, went horribly, but the goal was to understand the current state of technology and philosophy. More practically, I'm already using AI to help determine potential edge cases for unit testing, generate HTTP handlers, and create custom error messages (In my work with numerous front-facing devices, these detailed error messages are essential, which quite annoying to create a clear message), etc.\n\nSo yes, I personally think AI will change the programming world. Many of my peers likely never thought AI could code as capable as it does now, but it's currently at our doorstep. \n\nAre you willing to gamble with your future by thinking AI couldn't?",

Those tools allow creatives to work faster and produce better output. \n\nAI does the same. Creators can use AI to become better designers. Designers complaining about AI will be left behind, same as the designers who insisted manual typesetting was better than software, or the guys who argued film cameras were superior to digital.\n\nResisting AI is short-sighted.
