We lack the genetic diversity that dogs have and even though many, especially Americans, use the word \"race\" to describe someone, it doesn't describe a group of individuals accurately enough. \n\nRacism is a social construct however. Before, if you were from another city then fuck you. Your religion was different? Fuck you. And sometimes not. The Portuguese started slavery (they didn't invent it but they, and Europeans in general, made it an impressive logistic machine on a scale never before seen) but it wasn't right by christians standards and the Church couldn't really justify people having slaves. Unless. What if they didn't have soul? Then they wouldn't really be humans, and you could do whatever you want with them. Except it's easy to see that slaves cry, so what if slavery was a good thing for them? They work for free but we give them christian education which is a good thing! We're actually the good guys for saving their souls. Then you had colonization which people are still justifying by saying that hospitals have and roads have been constructed. \n\nRace isn't a social construct, it just doesn't apply here. Racism is.\n\nEdit : the US Wikipedia page does have race as a social construct. It's not the same \"race\" as biology and basically describes a mix of ethnicity and culture. It's not something, however, that could be found in my country. That also means that Anon is even more wrong because using the first definition, race can't be used to divide humans into subgroup, and using the second, race is a social construct, so in absolutely none of these definition this guy is right.",

If you try to classify english and welsh as a race then you just run into the same issue again with the Scottish and so forth until you end up saying the Japanese and the english have to be classified as the same race. Race theory originated in America because you had whites and blacks but noone in between. Once you consider the whole world though it quickly falls apart. Thats why we say race is a social construct because the distinctions are drawn arbitrarily and change with changes in social attitudes. Biologically there are differences between people and to some degree you can predict those differences through outward appearance or ethnicity, but it's a pretty poor predictor in most cases unless the population went through a bottleneck that significantly reduced the genepool.",

I stated multiple times that I've been using the scientific definition that specifically can't be used to divide people into races. The definition of \"race\" you're talking about isn't scientific, it's just what is commonly used to by people to talk about differences in skin colors or descriptives traits.
