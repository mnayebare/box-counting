Hobby, I would in my (probably very bias) opinion say that the vibe is that everyone is thinking we are 3-5 years away from AI that can do anything on a computer a human can do, better. Everything from software development, to video editing, to AI research. \n\nNot 100% of the researchers, but I would say the majority, and that shift from minority to majority was sudden and recent. \n\nI think if you want to see what those particular researchers would probably say is how the next few years look like -\n\nwww.situational-awareness.ai\n\nI keep sharing this to people who are interested enough to want a place to start researching the topic.

This is just one more of those steps with many more to come. It's not some global conspiracy, it's how humans evolve.\n\nRich people will get richer from it, yes. But so will non rich people like myself who have seen their retirement best eggs grow.\n\nSome jobs and businesses will go away, and other jobs and businesses that we literally can't fathom today will come from it. People will need to learn and grow with the technology, so it's not without effort.\n\nThis is not unlike the buggy whip manufacturers opining that cars are bad 100+ years ago. I don't want to live in a world where we live in fear of advancing for the greater good just because a few rich people will get more wealthy because of it.\n\nAnd yes, there is an entire conversation to be had about security and privacy with AI, but that doesn't change the core of what I'm saying.",

That creating a tool which is meant to do all the things humans can do, better, cheaper and faster, is actually very much different than anything that has ever happened before?\n\nUntil now, no technology has disrupted one fundamental truth - the rich depend on the poor to survive. Every bite of food they eat, every article of clothing they wear, the homes they live in, the people who keep them safe from angry mobs - all working people.\n\nThe future of AI is that all of these people are replaced my machines that are owned by the rich and for the first time the fundamental power relationship is changed and ordinary working people no longer have any power, even en masse.\n\nI'm not sure how you can possibly both champion the possibility of this technology to replace all current skilled and creative labor in one breath, and in the next say that somehow humans will be able to find some other way to survive when every avenue to do so has a machine who will work longer, faster, harder, with no breaks, for no salary.\n\nIt does not advance the greater good to eliminate the means that people use to support themselves. If you want to introduce this specific technology you must first create a world where people do not need jobs to survive.",

When there are 6 year long waiting list to enter trade school because that's all there is?\n\n\nWages drop to minimum wage. Unpaid internships become common. Every Tom and Harry starts a plumbing business and will come and unclog your drain for $19.99. Mandatory unpaid overtime because if you don't, there are 160 guys waiting to take your job.\n\n\nThere is no barrier to entry in the trades. And I'm not saying the trades aren't skilled. I'm saying the majority of white collar workers, and people in general, can learn the trades via relative short trade schools and OJT.\u00a0\n\n\nThe trades will be flooded and suddenly it's not going to be so great anymore.\n\n\n\n\nEditing to add:\nThe same is going to happen to nursing and other medical fields jobs that don't have strong moats.
