Surveillance of public places generally falls below that line, so for example red light cameras do not violate the 4th amendment, but in principle government surveillance is subject to 4th amendment analysis. This is, for example, at the heart of the dispute around police-operated cellular stations.\n\nPrivate surveillance is regulated by rules like trespassing, licensing requirements for radio transmitters, and so on.",

If they have wanton access to your GPS data because it's public for some reason, it doesn't matter if they use AI to analyze it or if they use Bob from accounting to analyze it, at least from the perspective of the 4th amendment.\n\nYes, we need better privacy laws, if only to address what types of data *should* have the expectation of privacy and which data has *zero* expectation of privacy.",
