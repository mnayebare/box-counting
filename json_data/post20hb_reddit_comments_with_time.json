                    "body": "Yeah, I worked for an agency where we honestly did pretty cookie cutter sites.  That isn't to say that we were cheap, just that we blew a lot of money on advertising.  \n  \nWhich, honestly, isn't a bad approach.  One of my coworkers was married to someone who wrote erotic novels, a lot of erotic novels, with a lot of assistance from ghost writers.  She was spending roughly half of what she earned on advertising, but she earned $80,000 a month (i.e. close to a million dollars a year) doing this.  So, not bad.\n\nBut it is kind of depressing living in such a world where nothing really matters other than the advertising budget.  The silver lining is knowing that AI in this regard isn't making things worse, but rather preserving the status quo, and also knowing that there are people out there who really do appreciate craft and show it, but finding those people and making something that resonates with them is hard.",

                            "body": "For companies that spit out \"cookie cutter\" sites, I feel like AI is almost guaranteed to render them obsolete, because it seems like it's just reskinning a template at that point, which AI is getting better and better at generating.  AI-generated sites will become the new baseline for this segment of the industry, so these companies need to adapt or die.\n\nIt feels a lot like when Bootstrap was the defacto UI lib. It worked well for generic use cases but quickly falls short when you need something purely custom. Similarly with cheap, AI generated sites, they'll likely work well for 80% of client use cases, but the clients that need something truly unique will need skilled devs and designers to create that end result (and will have to pay a premium cost to do so). \n\nIt's not a matter of \"AI will replace me\". It's a matter of \"what value can I provide on top of AI?\" You just have to adapt your skills in order to _extend_ the new baseline rather than _reinventing_ it. \n\n- Invest in truly understanding the web platform (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \n- Don't invest more time than necessary learning UI frameworks.\n\nWhen the time comes, you're gonna have to know how to read and understand the code that's spat out by AI in order to augment its capabilities.",

I have seen non technical people demo pretty cool projects with tools I had never heard of. The issue I'm seeing with older Devs right now is that they reduce the technology to the chatbots and cursor. We're at the stage right now where the startups are moving faster towards big revenue numbers, partially due to a fear that their product will be obsolete in a few years and partially because the pressure in enterprises to adopt AI is so strong so selling is easier. I spoke with a series A VC last year who told me that many of the companies they invest in are in stealth but have multiple millions in revenue. This is because they are targeting big enterprises so they don't need public marketing schemes and don't want to give away their idea as they know it is reproducible. The result of this is that the state of the industry is hidden. The foundation models are public and get big attention but applications built on top of them are not.\n\nFor webdev people say Bolt is pretty excellent. I know they were one of the fastest companies to ever to go from launch to 20 million in revenue so obviously their product isn't a total fraud. It's a young tool and will surely improve. I would at least keep an open mind about it if I were you. People called the internet overhyped initially because the applications people could use on it for free were shit",

To me it seems like they just have unrealistically slow expectations of the pace they should be working at now. On the knowledge side, if you worked at a slower pace for years you would have only been able to gather experience at that pace. Someone working in a fast paced team now can acquire far more knowledge than before.\n\nThat and the fact that LLMs are just much better tools for research and solving issues. Often in software concepts illustrated in theory would lack practical examples. With LLMs I can ask for examples in code and increasingly add to the complexity of those examples. That takes away a lot of the intimidating factor that existed before, and makes it easier to implement and experiment with yourself. \n\nA senior engineer who has years working with the same code base of course still has an advantage, but a senior with bad habits from when things moved slower and is over confident in their knowledge, is going to be passed out faster than before. \n\nThe startup I work for had 5 engineers. The 2 older ones (early 30s) who architected the backend before I arrived are our biggest issue. One has since left because he wasn't happy with expectations from the new younger CTO and the other is causing us issues every week. I took over a blocker he had for weeks when I arrived and solved it in 2 days. He is constantly resisting sharing info on features and issues because he knows he will be shown up if one of us takes over. It's anecdotal of course but it's the pattern I've seen.",

It's just a simple understanding of trajectory.\n\nIt might take longer for people to fully trust AI to do jobs, but there will still be massive layoffs as they have a single engineer acting as a manager for an AI task-force, rather than actual people doing grunt work.

But when it comes to understanding requirements, architecting projects, third party integrations and more complex coding it is REALLY bad.\n\nIt's a great productivity tool, but like you said, if you never find yourself needing to change it or even program from scratch you may be doing stuff that could have already been done with low/no code solutions already.\n\nBut I get that a lot of people here are doing agency work or other smaller, less functional websites that are more about producing the same thing frequently than bespoke function or complexity.  That's a valid way to earn a living and we probably will see AI eat up a lot of those jobs (though you'll still need someone who understands enough to fix when it's wrong.)",

Either their lack of commitment to the tool, there inability to prompt correctly or maybe even more obvious, their reluctance to let disruption happen to the craft they love so much.  Regardless, most of the software that the industry creates is basic CRUD applications, and frontier LLMS are MORE than capable at helping expedite that process - this goes well beyond \"basic CRUD forms\" and even includes fleshing out quality business logic.",

For example I want to use structured outputs more, whereas others might want the chat bot aspect of LLMs\n\n> Why not just post publicly?\n\nWe've gotten deep in this thread so i thought at that point I'd just message you, but i can share it yeah.\n\nWhere do you reckon I share it? r/webdev?

It kind of makes sense though - the AI was never trained on _your_ specific problem, so unless your problem is generic (like a helper class or common dev pattern), the AI is going to do a lot more hallucinating.\n\nAs a concrete example, I see it when using CoPilot/vscode to write php docblock comments for my class methods while building out boilerplate. I would write the function signature, using a super clear and obvious name to state what it should do, likewise with parameter names (etc.), and after starting `/**`, it'll copy the docblock from a completely unrelated method (like the constructor). Makes me wonder if it read what I just wrote at all. It does this much more often in larger codebases and even just large class files with a lot of methods.\n\nSo I use it a lot like you do, surgical strikes to save time switching Windows and wading through ads and spam to look up a solution. But that being said, I never accept anything it provides at face value. I'll review every line and often rewrite half of it. \n\nAnd just from seeing and knowing every day how many hallucinations a tool like CoPilot still has, I can tell you vibe coding is going to lead to some serious tech debt in the future.\n\nFor a small throw-away utility, like a side tool you need to process some data, I'll be more lenient there and largely vibe-code. I'm still reviewing every line, just not as picky about style or best practices here.\n\nBut ultimately, _I'm_ dictating the logic and architecture, and it's just saving me time, clicks, and typing.",

If you have a few quality senior engineers who can now spit out boilerplate in a matter of minutes, why would the team ever scale up to a potential pre-LLM size?

There were modals, quizzes, textareas and many different form elements on the page.\n\nAfter seeing that I changed the way I start my new projects. I describe the page I want in detail to Claude and have it create the design for me. Then I put that design into a new route (I usually put it on 127.0.0.1/vision) and try to make mine look as good (better, if possible) than that.

Practically everything a programmer does is going to create, read, update, and/or delete stuff, often across some sort sort of communication channel, backed by one or more data store of some sort. It's more a description of the environment than anything else. Figuring out all the things you're going to CRUD, and how all the information is going to transform and mutate in the progress is the hard part. Everything from building a website, to training an ML system, to implementing that service bus for risk portfolio calculations is going to involve these operations.\n\nThe whole AI is going to replace programmers thing seems to be largely kids fresh out of school, that don't realise that most of the \"programming\" they are doing is just menial busy work that the seniors give them so they have a chance to explore the problem domain a bit, before being given actual tasks. That and hobbyists that spent a few months learning to code, and then decided that they are actually master system architects because they managed to wire together 10 or 20 files that run a chatbot or something of the sort. \n\nThese people have suddenly gained access to a tool that can understand the thing they're working on about as well as an expert that's never touched a particular codebase, but they don't have the context to realise that such an expert would need to spend a few months getting up to speed on everything before being confident enough to actually make any significant changes. They just see hundreds of lines getting generated, and figure that those lines are just as good as any other. It's sort of like deciding that some off-brand glue was good enough to hold structural components of a truck together, without understanding why most other people prefer to use mechanical fasteners for the job.",

And so can the new Gemini. You have no idea what you are talking about or you are just in denial.\n\nI have been programming for basically 40 years and I think it's asinine to try to write programs without a SOTA LLM and coding agent/environment these days. Of course it still needs help and I prefer to give it my own architecture rather than let it dictate it for a lot of things,  but the best models absolutely can design (and setup whatever using tool commands or computer use).

It's the spring in its step, it's the song in its heart. It's a marriage made in heaven. CEOs, who want nothing more than to drive their labor costs to zero, see the chance to employ a tireless servant who will generate stuff for them.  Doesn't matter that it's unsustainable crap because everything is built to be disposable.\n\nThat's the real shame of AI - not that it's taking jobs but that companies are willfully - gleefully - discarding the jobs.  And in their ignorance and greed, they don't understand the difference between engineered solutions and canned solutions.  Maybe they will in time, but not in time for a lot of us.",

I don't know if the stage was deliberately set for AI slop to slot into or if it was just a wonderful coincidence, but the past 20 years of \"platform companies\" that are built to be so over-extended that nobody even expects them to do their job (\"It's not YoutUbeAirBNBookazon's fault they can't police their quality or pick up the phone! At that scale, it's impossible!\") have primed the public for mediocre mostly-adequacy, the AI sweet spot.\n\nI think part of the problem is that as the willful gleeful ones take up the efficiencies, there is some effect that the bar is raised for efficiency and anyone left lagging will be outcompeted, especially with the positive feedback loops, so the field whittles down to the ruthless ones who were bastards first, the begrudging ones who eventually had to be bastards, and the ones that aren't around.\n\nI don't think it's ultimately sustainable. You've got problems like hollowing out the low-skill beginning jobs that feed the expert positions that are only made by automation. Especially in the tech industry, I think that's set to combine with the \"touchscreen simplicity\" problem to cause a real knowledge deficit in a generation or two. _Maybe_ the efficiency will dovetail with the dwindling supply and it'll suck but be sustainable-- I don't know.",

What AI is disrupting isn't creativity itself, but the repetitive aspects that were never the truly creative parts anyway.\n\nThe real art in web development isn't writing boilerplate - it's understanding user needs, designing meaningful interactions, and crafting solutions that truly solve problems. AI isn't great at this yet.\n\nWhat I've found powerful is focusing on the aspects AI struggles with:\n\n1. Contextual knowledge - Building systems that capture and organize the \"why\" behind decisions\n2. Domain-specific expertise - Understanding industry-specific needs that generic models lack\n3. Architecture and systems thinking - Designing cohesive systems rather than individual components\n\nFor documentation specifically, I've seen remarkable improvements when shifting focus from writing everything manually to creating structured systems that guide AI to produce meaningful output.\n\nInstead of feeling like I'm \"watching a robot make everything,\" I've started viewing AI as a tool that handles the tedious parts while freeing me to focus on higher-level thinking. It's a bit like how we once feared compilers would eliminate programming jobs because they automated assembly code writing.\n\nThe key is evolving our skills. The developers who will thrive aren't those who write the prettiest CSS or the most elegant functions - they'll be those who can organize knowledge, provide proper context to AI tools, and think at system levels rather than component levels.",

Someone else does your job cheaper than you and you don't get paid, wages are driven down, and there are fewer jobs in your market. AI is disrupting the job market but there is still a big demand for good developers. One of the biggest assets of AI is a good developer won't get slowed down by syntax with AI leading to greater versatility in changing stacks.

People try to  make prompting an LLM sound like you have to be a genius to interact with an LLM, but the reality is that they are chatbots. Incredibly advanced chat bots. Getting help, especially if you have code samples, is as easy as asking a question.\n\nThe thing ruining the industry is the people thinking that an LLM is smart enough or experienced enough to outright replace devs. (Cough cough management cough cough). \n\nSure, LLMs are good enough to help with how to implement a specific feature. But to be the sole engineer tying in many features together in an organized way in a solid code base that is well engineered? We all know that just isn't the case. Yet, and may never be.\n\nAs many others have mentioned, an LLM is great at making us more productive, but all LLMs just aren't at the point where you can be like \"Make me a Facebook clone\" and it'll come up with something a Sr dev could. Ask it \"build me a nav bar on modern web standards in X framework that's responsive designed\", it's probably going to do pretty good.

It probably already has tbh if you\u2019re that worried.\n\nI\u2019ve spent many an hour poking and prodding ChatGPT/Gemini/DeepSeek/Cursor/Llama/Mistral/Claude, etc. I\u2019ve tried them all, and not one of them has been able to create a properly engineered application with good design, no matter the prompting.\n\nEvery single one of them however, can create an application that *looks* good on the surface, until you actually examine it. \n\nThey are just fancy auto-completes for developers right now. The only way to use them productively for software engineering is to write your pseudocode explicitly and have it fill in the template.\n\nWhich, if that\u2019s what is required\u2026you\u2019ve already done 80% of the work lol, so it\u2019s not even a huge timesaver. \n\nWhat they are much better at however is education. Working with a tool you\u2019ve never worked with before, they can help guide you. See syntax you don\u2019t understand, they can explain it. Don\u2019t use them as a replacement for skills, use them to augment your own.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should be worried that we\u2019ll have an AGI capable of performing highly intelligent software engineering above a junior-dev level anytime soon. The current industry consensus is that an architecture shift beyond transforms is needed for higher level intelligence which software engineering requires. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the day IS coming where we\u2019ll all slowly lose the ability to code as we only interact in natural language with an AI who does all the work. But that day is still a long way out. \n\nI hope it\u2019s at least a decade or two to give me time to tinker and have more fun learning, but either way it\u2019s not the end of the world. Industries evolve, industries change, so do your skills. You\u2019ll just need to identify the next best area you can improve in and start there. \n\nAnd don\u2019t worry, literally every profession is in the same boat, not just developers.",

I work mostly with front-end, and as an user, I stopped looking at \"beauty\" a long time ago, and I'm actually happy when the site or app goes straight to the point. That's what people want. That's why companies use Linktree instead of their websites on the URL spot in their bio, even though all info could be found in the website.\n\nDon't think of it in terms of ruining, and more like times are changing, new trends are coming. If you get past the nostalgia and the blaming part, and focus on how you can be part of it, more chances you have to stick around.\n\nThis works for jobs, for politics, and for many more things.

What it is going to do is increase the value of \"bespoke\" human creations. We are already seeing a natural aversion to AI in many instances by your average person.\n\nThere is going to be disruption in the short term but I have faith that long term new markets for physical art only humans create will boom. Software in particular will course correct to broadly land on the best practices that use AI but not in such in all encompassing way we see it being forced on us now. Its not entirely the same but people had very similar reactions to the calculator when it was invented.\n\nAlso in the grand scheme I will be honest...AI being used for software dev is the least of my concerns with it atm. A relatively innocuous use of this tech to be clear. The larger issue at play with AI is, in my opinion, more to do with operational control of data and the fact that our society has placed more value on human beings outputting manual labor while AI outputs creative works - this dynamic is something deeply worrisome to me.",

In my experience, AI is able to help me with some frontend elements if I can't do them well enough, but it does it wrong and generates code that often doesn't work. It takes more time and I'm sure an experienced programmer would do it faster. In the backend, I don't even see the point of using AI, because the code is of poor quality and contains bugs that I then have to fix, and it takes more time than writing it from scratch myself. \n\nFor years, when creating websites or online stores, we used ready-made templates that someone had already created some time ago and we just had to adapt them to client's requirements. Because it's cheaper to pay that $50 for a template than $5,000 for the work of a programmer who will create it from scratch. I don't see AI changing anything on this topic. Larger companies want a template written from scratch based on their design anyway. \n\nTo be honest, I don't really understand how AI could destroy anyone other than freelancers/compnies who wrote very simple and basic code.",

Social media consolidating into platforms, and those platforms-- for reasons of security, simplicity, and consistency-- took away a lot of the artistic decision-making ability, save for the ability to write.\n\nFrom there, consolidation meant that there were few monolithic styles out there and the focus and virtue was paid to optimization. That led to more expectation of consistency on the viewers' and clients' part, and the attractive ease of using a pre-made framework to achieve consistency on the developer's. Diversity went down and utility went up, which adds up to experiments and outliers being anywhere from \"more weird\" to just \"wrong\" because practicality and efficiency are mode in which people browse. \"_They_ are doing something. _You_ need to stay out of their way.\" is the axiom.\n\nI don't know if Web 2.0 was inevitable or not, and I'm more mulling than lamenting, but just to say that there was a time when it legitimately had a viable more-artistic trajectory.",

It's high time in all industries that the lazy and mediocre cowardly class of excuse makers are shaken up to step their efforts up. People shouldn't be settling for punching clocks just to eat anyway, if that is what one is doing then UBI is probably a better path.\n\nBeing a unique and skillful person should be everyone's goal, instead of just going along to get by, as is the conventional ethos of modern mankind.

Worked great for a few years but ever since AI can code I can now do the coding myself, at a much greater pace. In a year our webapp probably leaped 3years in progress. She is now mostly weeding out the AI 'problems' instead such as dead code and duplicate code. She too uses AI to do the coding while she has the ability to steer the code in the correct direction while I accept blidly what code I get. Sonnet 3.5/3.7 has more than one occasion blasted out 800 lines of flawless code, but also given me 200 lines with several duplicates.\n\nIt's not perfect yet, but the insane progression from AI and correct prompts does make you question just how far this can go. I'm sure if I knew coding as well as I know machining I could make use of AI in a much more accurate way, probably to the point where I'd just be supervising the AI and rarely ever code by hand again.",

Nothing too fancy.  With AI, I can outline the overall plan and then start small with the basic parts of the tool I want to create, debug, discuss, change, update etc.\n\nI find that by having to verbalise what my plan is, the AI can point out where things may be more difficult than I expect and also it keeps me on track towards the goal I initially started with.  It is also good at suggesting small tweaks that improve the accuracy of my tool.\n\nIt's perhaps the discussion part of it that I value more than the code, but it does type a lot faster than I can :)",
