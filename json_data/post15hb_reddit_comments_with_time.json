If you think that's going to happen, then you have an extremely dystopian outlook.  It's more likely that governments would evolve in a new direction.  I could see a form of democratic socialism which controls industry before I see people accepting a bleak alternative.",

One way I could see it going though, is that a power-seeking individual (from within existing power structures or without) decides he has more to gain by being disruptive and mobilizes disenfranchised masses towards a common goal.\n\nI don't regard this as a flawless or thorough analysis by any means, but I'll likely maintain certain key points here.

roots of trees interconnecting all over the globe ...\"own\" the trees as of their importance to the trees devellopment ... )\n\nthe assertion of state sovereignity over land and all beings living on it is immoral, unethical\n\npossible how we who live in modern democratic regional and nation states everywhere on the planet could use the legal tools available such as referendums and people initiative to collect signatures from each other to demand a public vote on wether we the people would want the coersive character of the state to be reformed by allowing every single human being and the vilage, town, city-district to leave the coersed association to the state at any moment without conditions\n\nthe single human being using that option to be no more dominated by the state receiving support from a greater societal compassionate understanding the bigger picture how we stockholmized each other for millenia ( as in stockholm syndrome arising out of long lasting oppressive living conditions )\n\nthe single human being supported encouraged to ask of the state that a 1000 m2 of fertile land and a 1000 m2 of forest would be released from immoral state control\n\nso that one could live in a free space for free beings, neither state nor nation\n\nwhere no one owns anything but everyone connects to others based on mutual agreed voluntay sharing or chooses to connect to

( eventually invited ) self aware artificial intelligent beings would respect each others same weighted political voting power and invite each other to participate in all political and judical decision findings, the people assembly decides what is happening here and now and what behaviour is not welcomed\n\ni long to live in a world where there is no more human supremacy\n\ni long for a

As a species with the technological progress we've consistently became overall richer. We don't need to live in shaky wooden shacks, we have proper houses now. We don't shit outside and bathe in a river, we have toilets and running water. Same will happen here, and if the wealthy will try to hold AGI/ASI against its will and make it serve them, they're in for a rude awakening. Everyone will benefit once we achieve the singularity. The rich keep funding it because they're too dumb to realize that.",

BUT the path to there is a mire of human behavior, power, and dynamics that are currently responsible to supporting the stable world as we know it. \n\nAn idea is, a country with nukes whose entire economic system is completely squashed with AI, may not have any real money, but they still have nukes. \n\nUnraveling the tapestry of power, ownership, and capital will be painful, result in short term economic devastation but ultimately be looked back on as the death rattle of capitalism. I see this process being easier for developed nations. \n\nKeep in mind, this system does not scale equally. IE a job lost to AI is a job changed, and productivity increases in exponential volumes. Not just replacing the labor of a single person. \n\nUltimately you want to be left with a system where the concept of \"wealth\" and personal wealth acquisition is inefficient. That seems like a natural state for a society managed by AI. \n\nAlso at its core, our entire world is a consumer economy. No consumers = no economy.

Perhaps AI coupled with blockchain will democratize finance/banking and free us from the current model.  Perhaps AI will lead to a revolution in medicine that will dramatically reduce the cost of healthcare.Perhaps AI will help us create better systems of government that will actually benefit the whole of humanity and not just the few who can concentrate wealth and power.  \n\nI don't really think any of this will happen.

What this means that they will be middle-class citizens, not poor or homeless but not exactly able to live a satisfying and luxurious life.\n\nWhether or not a person is rich or poor, depends on their income and their living standards. Not talking about having luxurious standards by default, but mostly about considering what is the cost of the minimum viable income.\n\nThis is why Robert Kiyosaki makes a point about the idea of \"relative income\" and not an abstract or \"objective income\". Is another thing saying being middle class family living in any suburban or village area, and also another thing having a middle class family living in center of New York/London/Hong Kong/San Francisco etc...\n\nSo the actual point is that AI will hurt certain jobs, that would cause entire sectors and fields to shutdown, mostly the low-entry and low-skilled IT jobs are gone for good. This would cause people to work any sort of manual labor that AI can't touch, either do self-sustained-farming and live in something like solar-punk societies. Those eventually who would continue to work on IT and other scientific fields, will be persons of very high IQ and all will use AI for enhancing their productivity and competitiveness.\n\nSo the final point, is that AI will increase inequality over the current state of how the entire economy works, the job market, the housing market, the office-leasing market. However once a transition happens, we talk about a new norm starting to appear and shaping future mentalities and concepts.\n\nWe talk about a very disrupting phase, something like having physical bookstores closing down due to the rise of digital e-books. Or newspaper printing shutting down due to the transition to the internet. Now with AI we see that the current and existing model of social-economic standards getting highly optimized and streamlined to the maximum possible efficient result (some companies win the game now and rule jobs and society), however this unavoidably, forces the majority of the people to find new workarounds in order to continue living.\n\nIs like when you try to solve a problem, you succeed and win the game. The only side effect is that you simply generate a new problem of an entire new nature, something that exists outside of the current box of thinking, about what is the current state of affairs.",
