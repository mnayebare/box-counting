They did this in a lot of high profile cases such as the Madeleine case in Portugal and the scott Peterson case in CA and both times there was serious issues with reliability and in both cases the police used it as evidence. And when you\u2019re a juror and the prosecution talks about something as if it\u2019s 100% solid science and if you have a shitty defense attorney, you could easily end up in prison for a crime you didn\u2019t commit all because a fucking dog, expecting a treat, decides to signal there was a body somewhere months prior regardless of renovations, or cleaning which is just horseshit. For example, in the scott Peterson trial, they used a cadaver dog in the marina where he allegedly launched his boat in an area where he never logically would be if he was trying to dump a body on a huge dock where you couldn\u2019t easily lower a 100lb body into a tiny ass motorboat. This dock was covered in fish guts and sprayed with saltwater day in day out for weeks and then some dipshit with a dog goes over there and the dog claims to smell a body and you may think that\u2019s dumb, but in jury interviews it actually made a huge impact in their decision despite being complete bullshit.",

The same can be said for other non-white races in the US around relationships but to a much lesser extent. If you only interact with people who look like you on a daily basis, you are not going to be good at identifying people who don't look similar to you.\n\nI grew up in a family and community that was extremely diverse, as a result I do not have the issue telling apart people of different races and can not remember any point where that was the case.  As I got older, around my teenage years and after I had learned the backgrounds of enough people in my community and family, I became pretty good at making a guess in narrowing down the localized region someones family might be from.\n\nFor something most people can probably relate to... it's no different from how when you hear a genre of music you have never listened to before it can be difficult to make out the lyrics or how when you hear a new language that doesn't share roots with a language you are already familiar with you tend to not be able to differentiate separate words in a spoken sentence.\n\n^(edit:)\n\n[^(https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/)",

Yes it was expensive, but having the security of being able to see naturally is so worth it. I kept reaching for glasses the first few weeks/months whenever i woke up but ive grown into it. I know the feeling of looking weird without glasses, being so used to it, but you grow out of it. Also, i dont know where you are, but I financed my surgery its like 150 a month, interest free for first 24 months or something. Worth it, seriously from one blind person to another. Also, i guess because my senses are more acute, i am a chef by profession, as you said, smell, taste, texture, are all way more sensitive than my seeing counterparts, it basically is who I am now, and always have been since I can remember. I was always the chef growing up even at a young age, it just comes naturally to me what flavor should be, I assume because my heightened non vision senses. Glad im not alone in this. PM me if you wanna chat about getting you Lasik, as I said, so worth it. It still blows my mind just having perfect vision every time i go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. Im 34. Used to just feeling my way around the shower or bathroom or just knowing where things are but still being careful with the foot shuffle (i have a cat also) so the shuffle is necessary so i dont step on him.

It took a long time before I realized just how bad it was and a lot of little experiments--I once told a guy about it at a party, who proceeded to leave the room and reintroduce himself to me under a different name several times. I only found out when one of his friends told him to cut it out, he had apparently done it at least five times by that point. I became more convinced after mentioning it to my mother, who immediately went, \"Oh, you know who else is terrible at recognizing faces, it's your dad.\" He is also apparently really annoying to watch movies with. It's not all that rare, something like a 2.5% prevalence, and it's usually genetic. Do you know if either of your parents seem to have trouble with it? I've also heard (would have to track down the source) that it is commonly associated with dyscalculia, which is an inability to conceptualize numbers and how they relate to one another, which I also suspect I have.\n\nI definitely do that, \"wow, don't they look like each other?\" thing a lot when apparently the similarity is that both of them are wearing faces, and have to focus very hard to not mix up who is who when \"similar\" looking people are in the same area. The worst is when I run into someone at an unfamiliar location, and they clearly know me, but I don't know who they are because I'm sorting through a mental list of literally everyone I know to try and match something about their current appearance. I've just started to be open about having it with people right off the bat, because it makes me anxious to feel like an asshole when I can't recognize people. Now a lot of my friends will automatically tell me who someone is right away, or even tell me right away who *they* are before I have to try and guess.\n\nThere are a few people I can recognize right away, which is actually more jarring now than not recognizing folks. Why do I recognize them? What is it about them that I can instantly go off of? It's weird.",

The first two don't work for black people very well or any group similar hair, skin or eye color to each other. \nBlack people pay attention to other things, smaller details like tattoos, jewelry hair style etc. I've seen this done to crowds to illustrate this problem, a fake mugging in front of black crowd and a different white crowd. The white people just say \"tall black guy\" black people described basically every identifying detail.\nIt largely fits along with what you're saying, but the black way of identification works for white people too, but white people descriptions are borderline worthless.",

The same can be said for other non-white races in the US around relationships but to a much lesser extent. If you only interact with people who look like you on a daily basis, you are not going to be good at identifying people who don't look similar to you.\n\nI think it has more to do with hair. White people just inherently have more variable hair. Hair colour alone is a huge factor, but there's also hair length. Black people's hair naturally grows outwards, so you have a vague sliding scale from bald to afro. But white people's hair naturally grows downwards, and that gives people landmarks to tell just how long someone's hair is (ear-length, chin-length, shoulder-length, etc) so different hair lengths are more immediately apparent on white people than black people.",

I know the best I'd likely be able to give, outside of them having some really stand out feature (or neat hair..I'd probably remember cool hair...), about some random I'd run into for 30 seconds would be 'err some white guy, think he had darkish hair maybe. Probably somewhere between not super short and not super tall and not super thin or super obese...that help?'.  I mean if I was really close to them I could at least get height vaguely relative to myself but even then it'd be +/- 7.5cm(3\") soooo yeah.... \n\nI'd be even worse at a lineup 'well that could be them, but so could 4 of the 6 other guys you've got there'... I say this with extreme confidence because as a teen I forgot what my then long distance girlfriend looked like between the first time we got together(we spent a good 10 days together) and the first time she flew over to meet me. Sitting next to my Nana who had given me a lift to the airport, Nana pointed at a girl 'is that her?' 'nope' then she waved and run over for a kiss, over her shoulder while she was hugging me I could see this damn cheeky grin from my Nana >_<",

Some guys knocked on my garage door (converted bedroom for teenage me) one night and when I opened it I got sucker punched in the face, thankfully I had two friends home with me so the guy that hit me and his friends held back to yell at us rather than continuing with the plan, which I assume was to beat the absolute shit out of me (given one had a trolley pole that wouldn't have been pleasant...).  Turns out they had the wrong house.... They yelled some crap about threatening phone calls but once they realised we had no fucking clue who they were or what they were talking about they backed off and left.\n\nBut yeah best I could give to the cops were 3 young white guys and one of them might have had long blonde hair but I wasn't sure and that was it. In my defence though I only ever saw them through one eye due to the other being full of blood and was more than a little stunned figuring out what the hell was going on... Pretty sure they thought I was full of it with the whole 'I don't know them' bit since my mum was standing next to me, they probably figured I giving a cover story or something.  They obviously didn't find them since I never heard back from them (I was kind of worried they might actually find whoever they were looking for...).",

If someone says two things look alike then they do for them. There is no objective way something looks because the very act of looking completely depends on the one doing the looking. \nMaths is much more objective and follows more ironed rules.

Modern convolutional neural networks work a lot better in B&W because it cuts heavily down on the processing required. Adding colour takes it from each pixel being processed as a floating point from 0 to 1 to each pixel being 3 floating points from 0 to 1, which doesn't just increase the processing requirements by 3 but instead also increases the data requirement as to get the same theoretical certainty with a higher feature dimension requires more data points.\n\nOn the flip side, just because a model isn't perfect doesn't mean it isn't useful, Amazon isn't throwing out its shopping assistant AI models just because it gets it wrong sometimes.

Most data sets are heavily biased towards white and Asian.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html\n\nThere are some extremely dark skin tones - like in parts of the Congos - where contrast is challenging, but there often is enough detail in most situations.\n\nEven in perfect situations, the models suffer with black faces.\n\nPut it in a different way: In order to train a face recognition model, you have to show it pairs of pictures of faces that are either different or of the sanm person. Repeat this millions of times and it learns what distinguishes different faces.\n\nDifferent ethnicities have different distinguishing features. If your data set is low on a particular ethnicity, your model will not learn how to tell people of that ethnicity apart.\n\nAs we model how the human brain works* - or how we think the human brain works - the learning process for our models is similar to that of humans. Most people struggle to distinguish between two individuals of other ethnicities if they have not been exposed to many people of that ethnicity. \n\nSource : I wrote a facial recognition system in South Africa specific for their ethnicities. It absolutely destroyed all commercial and open source alternatives.\n\n*A gross over simplification, but not too far from the truth.",

It's just a case of the algorithm not having enough training data of dark skinned people.\n\nThe 2 examples the commenter above gave aren't that that straight forward though. The data the recommended sentencing software is less a insufficient dataset, and more of a biased dataset, as it is drawn from past decisions influenced by human (racial) biases. The ML algorithm merely learns to mimic these biases. You could argue that data that includes racist biases is \"racist data\". But again I do agree that it is a bad term overall as it seems to ascribe agency to data.\n\nTaybot was intentionally fed racist tweets to get racist tweets out. So one could argue that it also was fed \"racist data\".\n\nSo maybe the two examples the commenter chose weren't the best, as they were only tangentially related to the cause to the bad output of the facial recognition software.

He quickly sent $100 million to two dozen well-regarded nonprofits working to provide shelter to homeless families across the country.\n\n>And since then, he has done something that even the nonprofits receiving his millions remark is highly unusual: He has given them life-changing money with virtually no restrictions, formal vetting, or oversight, according to Recode\u2019s interviews with eight of those funded by him and others familiar with his donations.\n\n>Funders of Bezos\u2019s stature typically cast an open call for proposals, spending months poring over applications from nonprofits and sometimes insisting on site visits, interviews, and reams of financial data. Bezos\u2019s team instead quietly cold-called the nonprofits he was already interested in backing, asked them for a few 500-word answers, and then wired them millions of dollars in cash or Amazon shares within about six weeks of making initial contact.\n\n>Funders require nonprofits to fill out reports as often as every quarter, outlining the recipients progress on the funder\u2019s own favorite dozen-plus metrics. Bezos does require an annual report, but he doesn\u2019t even send a rubric; nonprofits can effectively create their own accountability and send him whatever type of update they want.\n\n>Funders are also prone to placing copious restrictions on their money to ensure it is spent on whatever it is they care about.

He quickly sent $100 million to two dozen well-regarded nonprofits working to provide shelter to homeless families across the country.\n\n>And since then, he has done something that even the nonprofits receiving his millions remark is highly unusual: He has given them life-changing money with virtually no restrictions, formal vetting, or oversight, according to Recode\u2019s interviews with eight of those funded by him and others familiar with his donations.\n\n>Funders of Bezos\u2019s stature typically cast an open call for proposals, spending months poring over applications from nonprofits and sometimes insisting on site visits, interviews, and reams of financial data. Bezos\u2019s team instead quietly cold-called the nonprofits he was already interested in backing, asked them for a few 500-word answers, and then wired them millions of dollars in cash or Amazon shares within about six weeks of making initial contact.\n\n>Funders require nonprofits to fill out reports as often as every quarter, outlining the recipients progress on the funder\u2019s own favorite dozen-plus metrics. Bezos does require an annual report, but he doesn\u2019t even send a rubric; nonprofits can effectively create their own accountability and send him whatever type of update they want.\n\n>Funders are also prone to placing copious restrictions on their money to ensure it is spent on whatever it is they care about. What does Bezos do? He\u2019s taken \u201cno strings attached\u201d to the extreme, effectively letting the nonprofits spend the money on anything that offers shelter to homeless families, even if the initiative was nowhere to be found on the original applications or grant agreements.",

If they are using ML then it all depends on the data points they decide to capture and the nodes they decide to use. So in the case of a neural network instead of having an if ( woman ) statement, they would have a node that uses gender as a data point. Kinda the same thing (loosely), just architected in a different way. Do you think they would use gender as a datapoint for an AI that is supposed to be gender neutral?",

As the algorithm runs it will adjust these weights, but each node runs a particular check. They each get a weighted input ( one or more ), does some logic, and produce an output. \n\n2. Again, the neural network would not know that women tend to play softball and men tend to play football. It wouldn't even know what a woman or a man was.\n\nNow what they could do is say the employer wanted candidates with a certain GPA and is given a dataset where most people with lower GPAs happened to be in a member of a particular sorority. They could count being a member of that sorority as negative, even though their GPA is not low. \n\nThat's just making incorrect correlations between two data points though.

It is a hardware design choice coupled with software that costs money to incorporate and for live video is very expensive. Newer model flagship phones of 2019 just got HDR video, you expect a medium tier security camera to have HDR that works outdoors for both people standing in direct sunlight and in shade? Even if this were true you would still have a higher accuracy on lighter skin than darker skin in more scenarios.\n\nIR sensors as others have mentioned are horrid at facial recognition over distance. The general rule is 10cm for 1m. What I mean by this is for every 1m in distance you lose an accuracy of 10cm. There would be no way a CCTV street cam 3m in the air could accurately perform facial recognition, sure it would be great for height and other dimensions and so I think it should be added. It still wouldn\u2019t affect the disparity between darker and lighter skin for facial recognition",

I'm saying that a racist system is a shortcut to BS claims like AI being racist (without evidence)\n\n> You're missing the point where they don't need to do it on purpose to count as racism. \n\nNo because the topic is regarding AI itself, not how it is used. People claiming racism need to show intent by the AI, which they cannot. For example, did the developers purposely design the AI to discriminate? - not to be confused with limitations of the software. What I find ridiculous is that in order to fix the issue with minorities, sampling needs to be done, but whenever companies like Google tried to collect them, advocates screamed \"racism\". Like how the fuck do you think software is made better? You can't complain about racism for AI that isn't perfect and then complain about racism again when companies try to collect data to build libraries for AI to learn from.  \n\n> It's like if you decide not to hire anyone that lives more then 10 miles from your headquarters to save on commuting time, but all black people lived 15 miles from it because of discriminatory housing policies, you wouldn't be intentionally cutting them out, but the net result would be de facto discrimination of black people who cannot meet the arbitrary requirement. \n\nMaybe there aren't enough black software engineers to hire. What majors are black people enrolling in college? What's that look like compare to the jobs after? No, let's put the burden on their recruitment, for which there is no evidence here, just nebulous blaming of whitey. \n\n> And i'd like to think that, if you heard of that being a problem, you'd amend your policy to combat the resulting injustice. Or at least vote for someone who promises to fix the discriminatory housing policies.\n\nHow did talking about AI development turn into this? lol\n\n> You know, like how people should support pressuring these companies to fix their software to better include minorities. \n\nI'm sure they want to fix it themselves.

It's not a simple problem, but it isn't a mystery how to solve it. It's just that it's not something that comes up enough in most testing for the programmers to realize it because they have ready access to people who would cause problems for it when stress testing. This has been an issue with almost every light sensor based mass market product ever made. In the early 2000s when automatic faucets started to come into vogue, black people stopped being able to wash their hands because the sensors weren't sensitive enough. This isn't a new problem, which only makes it worse that this is a problem since it should have been something they thought to compensate for, but they didn't and that's the problem.",

It's saying it's having trouble identifying and differentiating between all not white people.\n\nAlso, when people say AI is racist, they mean the way it was programmed adheres to the racial biasies of the programmer wether intentional or subconscious, under the latter which not thinking to test your software on enough black people to ensure it works on them falls. Having such a focus on one part of a population that you forget the other parts exist and therefore fail to equally serve the whole population is still a bias, and in this case it is a racial bias against black people. \n\nIt's not the fact that it's hard that's the problem. It's the fact that either they didn't care that it didn't work properly for black people and could cause inoocent people financial and social ruin. Or more generously, as I prefer to be, that they just were so focused on their own little world that they didn't even remember that black people existed when building their databases and incidentally created a system that can ruin innocent people's lives that's the problem. Maybe computers can't be racist (I think they can, especially as we come closer and closer to self aware AI, but whatever). More importantly here though, the people who build them definitely can be and in this case are.",

When I was responding to the original comment I was just trying to explain that that bias can occur without trying to introduce it purposely. Also yes ignorance and exclusion of data on a subconscious level does count as bias, but that doesnt mean it cancels out intention. Ill be honest and admit I didnt read the article, bc I was simply explaining the idea of AI prejudice as a concept, and assumed they tried to be as conscious of that as possible bc...that's their job as scientists. If they purposely left out images of minorities to create a fucked up AI then that's a whole different ball game. My whole point is we as a people could have all the best intentions in the world and try to cover all the angles we can possibly think of, to create a safe ethical AI...but theres just outcomes we can never foresee despite best efforts.",

Chinese or Middle Easterns from Canada would be called based on their country.\n\n\nThis can open up another topic because some Asians are born and raised in America and they don\u2019t really identify themselves as Taiwanese, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Some can\u2019t even speak their native language that their parents speak so they would say something like\n\n\u201cI\u2019m American but my parents are from _____ (China, Korea, etc) \u201c",

In ancient times people were described by skin colour but it wasn't like it is today where races are divided according continent. That came from enlightenment thinkers in the late 1700's. Blumenblach, along with Kant and Leclerc were probably the most influential writers on the topic. They believed that white people were the most pure humans, he argued that they are the most beautiful and closest to god and black people were the most impure. So the colour scale was not actually representative of skin colour but of a range of aspects that included perceived behaviour and things like 'softness' and 'beautiful skulls'. They theorised that other races were degenerative of white people. Blumenbach believed this was environmental, as in he believed black people would turn into white people if they lived in the correct environment. Others believed the races were innately separate, such as Meiners who used white to represent beauty and holy purity and black to represent ugliness and animal savagery. Once these theories became the driving ideas behind the definitions the actual skin colour of people became less important. Perhaps you could have lighter or darker skin than another race but you are still called the race you are because you came from a group of people that are described not just by skin tone but by the virtues perceived by those writers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color\\_terminology\\_for\\_race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_terminology_for_race) \n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann\\_Friedrich\\_Blumenbach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Blumenbach)\n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph\\_Meiners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christoph_Meiners) \n\nAnd yeah, those are the origins of the words we still use today...",

I'm assuming most of their training set is user data (non professional) so it's probably not the best quality which is an issue. \n\nTrying to get high quality professional quality photos would be hard due to rights issues, even though the photographers work isn't being used in the traditional sense.\n\nFinally, using a professional training set would probably be a bad predictor sense most photos it would try to identify and amateur and have terrible lighting.\n\nSo it's going to be a hard issue to resolve unless we make a huge advancement in digital imaging overnight.",

They tend to wear long shorts and Merch shirts. Skinny Male juggalos tend to wear faux dreadlocks/braids or have medium to long hair, and wear baggy pants, Jerseys and zip up hoodies. Both tend to have some form of goatee.\nFemales also tend to dress similar based on weight, fat female juggalos tend to wear large baggy pants and merch shirts, while always having an unwashed ponytail, most of the time with faded dyed streaks. Skinny female juggalos tend to dress like ravers with some type of dyed pigtails with yarn extensions or full on dreadlocks.",

That's not some inherent fact of photography. That's a choice in the way the camera is set up. Never mind that most cameras are capable of a really wide gamut it just washes out the colors. And never mind the part where I'm telling you it's perfectly possible to film black and white faces *together* in the same shot and have them all be legible. \n\nAlso, these systems have been shown not to work even in ideal conditions, with nice clear lighting (mugshots or license photo settings). It's not just in the real world they don't perform, they don't even perform in a lab.\n\nWould you describe a car that had some system that prevented anyone black from opening the door to be racist?

The factors that go into it aren't public (of course), but [you can see a list of examples here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System#Examples_of_policies).  Things like debt, traffic violations and cheating on examinations have nothing to do with facial recognition.\n\nAnd even if the Chinese Social Credit system *did* depend on facial recognition technology...so what?  We don't have that system, it's totally irrelevant.  It would be like banning traffic tickets because they could, under an authoritian regime, be used as justification to strip citizens of civil liberties.  Again, facial recognition is just a tool, one of many.\n\nA firearm would not have helped in her specific case, and I hope you don't make a habit of suggesting that to crime victims.  What would have helped was a fast and effective search after the fact.  Millions of dollars of taxpayer money were spent canvassing neighborhoods and investigating the wrong people (many of whom would have been negatively affected by the experience) because they lacked the ability to match a face photo with a guy who already had 40+ prior convictions.  That's a very heavy price to pay for your privacy.",

I know people always use the nazi Germany argument for this, but imagine if the US had this tech even just a few decades ago. Interracial relationships/cohabitation  was illegal in Florida until 1964. Until 1975, it was illegal for gay people to work for the government, and there were still anti-sodomy laws outlawing gay relationships in the US in Texas until 2003. It\u2019s easy now to look back and say \u201coh well that was wrong but we\u2019ve moved past that,\u201d but I just think that facial recognition is _way_ to much power for any imperfect/impermanent government to have.",

I'll admit I didn't read the article, so if this is non-contributing garbage let me know and I'll delete!\n\nI suspect they're using facial recognition as the first step toward classifying people as potential criminal or not. Since we're arguing public good and racism, we can say we don't care about what happens to the criminals and focus on non-criminals.\n\nIf you aren't a criminal, and the facial recognition system says you are who you say you are, you're good. You go about your day.\n\nIf you aren't a criminal, and the facial recognition gets it wrong, you now have a non-zero chance of getting flagged as a criminal in the second classification step, where it looks you up in whatever database.\n\nSo let's say police pull a black person over and are using the software on them. The system has a higher chance to mis-classify black people. They are now at a *higher* risk of being treated as a criminal than they would if the system worked correctly. Even if it messes up with all races some of the time, even small percentage biases equate to massive discrepancies at scale. I understand this will likely be used on CCTV, so it will likely lead to unnecessary interactions with the police even while you're just walking out and about.\n\nAdd into the fact that black people are already typically at higher risk of violent police escalation due to underlying biases (doesn't even have to be a conscious bias), and those discrepancies could end up with more people of one race being mistreated by authorities than another. Even if we strip away the racial mistreatment, even just being held up for an extra 10 minutes while they try to verify your identity, can be frustrating, especially if it's racially biased.\n\n**However**. It's important to bring it into the full context. There's already an underlying racial bias that makes police (at least sliiightly) more likely to approach minorities as if it's a dangerous situation. If this facial recognition can help rewire those biases by showing that most people aren't criminals, the *overall* number of people being unnecessarily harassed due to *subconscious* biases (excluding actual racists) might go down. Yes, using this system, more people of one race will be miscategorized as a criminal --- but is that number less than the number of people of that race *already being approached as a criminal due to underlying biases?*\n\nThat makes the whole situation grey in my eyes, but it's late and I could be overlooking obvious facts. It's not an easy calculation, because it's hard to compare a cop approaching a car more on edge because of a person's race versus a facial recognition system accidentally calling you an armed drug dealer, and however they're approaching you after *that*. \n\nAnd it all depends on the different uses for the system and how sensitive/educated the police using it are. If police violence isn't high anyways, it will still lead to disproportionate annoyance at best.",

The idea that it's too hard in this day and age to get pictures of people from a wide variety of ethnicities doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nThe problem isn't that there's no way to actually training on a bunch of different ethnicities. The problem is that many people rarely remember to do so, or feel that it's inconvenient to put in the effort to do so. Which might fly for a cheapo camera, but isn't an acceptable standard for law enforcement facial recognition",

It's like if London police bought a single type of rifle for their police, and the EC issued a statement about how they're worried that there's no real consensus on how to regulate weapons in general across the whole fucking EU.\n\nTHERE'S A BIT OF A GAP BETWEEN THOSE TWO ISSUES.\n\nAnd then the article keeps going downhill from there.

They\u2019re recipes for learning to make predictions from data. \u201cClass imbalance\u201d, as it is referred to in the field is a problem for learning unbiased models. Not unbiased in the social sense of preferring a group of people over others because they\u2019re more like you (to vastly over simplify the issue), but unbiased in that they will very likely be better at classifying the majority class in the data set they have learned from. The models (not to be confused with algorithm; they aren\u2019t the same thing) aren\u2019t worse at classifying western minorities because the programmers are racist. They\u2019re worse because they\u2019re trained on samples from western societies, where minorities are not going to be equally represented in a representative data set because, as the title for the groups states, they\u2019re minorities.\n\nThere are plenty of reasons the bias in these models may be present, but it almost certainly is not because the programmers are racist. In fact, the machine learning community is very ethnically and nationally diverse.\n\nIf the models do have significantly worse performance on minority groups, they obviously shouldn\u2019t be deployed in social systems, especially for justice.\n\nMost people aren\u2019t hateful. Please don\u2019t confuse model bias with algorithm bias or racism on the part of the programmers. It is a very complex issue in machine learning, both socially and technically. There\u2019s a whole sub field called \u201calgorithmic fairness\u201d dedicated to learning unbiased models. It is not an easy problem to address technically and it will get better in the future.",

Then why aren't they using separate algorithms for blacks and whites? \n\nAnyway, it sounds like a technical problem, not a social one.",

Which means it's generally harder for cameras to pay attention to darker skinned people - - not because it's actually technically impossible/difficult, but because there aren't enough people in tech who see enough black people to think \"Ah yeah, I need to include some dark-skinned friends in this beta test, and I need to write my code to account for different skin tones.\" This becomes more evident when, every time a new camera innovation comes out, black people say \"but it doesn't work for me,\" and it takes a trivial amount of time for the company involved to fix the problem (e.g., such as when Microsoft has a camera that was supposed to be able to track and focus in on people in range of the camera, but was basically blind to black people in frame, and was able to fix it within maybe a month of people making YouTube videos about it). \n\nSimilarly, people surrounded by light-skinned people are likely to forget to train their ML algorithm to detect facial features from a full range of ethnicities, leading said programs to have a hard time detecting people who fall outside the training samples.\n\nBasically, tech isn't immune to the oversights of the people who make it.",
