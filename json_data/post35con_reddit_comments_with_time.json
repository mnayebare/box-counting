Under CBP policy, advanced searches require reasonable suspicion of a violation of law enforced or administered by CBP or a national security concern and require the approval of a senior manager (at a Grade 14 level or higher, or a manager with comparable responsibilities) prior to conducting the search.",

While I was there, the CBP officers were interrogating a student from Kazakhstan who had tried to enter on his F1 student visa 3 months before classes start (this was June and his classes were starting in September). The officers were a little confused about what to do and the supervisor was minded to enter him as a tourist B2 for 6 months and then he'd have to re-enter before his classes. His stated reason for coming early was to 'hang with his friends'.\n\nThings took a turn for the worse when they looked at his phone, found a photo of him wearing a waiter uniform. They worked out which restaurant that was and they asked him how much he was paid etc. As I left, it looked like they were about to deny him for unauthorized work. I did feel bad for him, as his English was very limited and he was basically self-incriminating with every thing he said. But it did seem that they had him red handed working in the US from a quick search of his Instagram.",

Told them the truth that i\u2019m really just visiting and they let me go after 2 hours. They gave me 180 days to stay according to the passport stamp and of course I up and left after 3 months.",

I'm retired and I'm in no hurry, I don't have anything better to do.\n\nThey'll have a field day with all my dirty bomb detonation and disaster recovery PhD research, thousands of papers and research materials. When they get to the pictures of my extensive gun collection, that will about do it for them, they'll be foaming at the mouth with anticipation.\n\nI think they'll likely be providing me with a bed and meals before they get too bored to continue. And that's without the thousands of deeply suspicious cat pictures and videos.\n\nI'm sure I'm probably on a government watch list for my views and comments about that nice Mr. Trump. /s",
