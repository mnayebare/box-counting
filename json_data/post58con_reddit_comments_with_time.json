Got a short haircut and I am mostly male again in faceapp and 50/50 in nyckel. You could pull back your hair so only the face is mainly in the picture. \n\nFacial hair, facial expression, eye brows, makeup, lighting and ornaments also affect the ai a lot. Its very easy to skew it into a certain direction. But people kind of also look at all these things a lot to gender someone.\n\nSo I guess making these things part of the picture for analysis makes sense. Obviously a very masculine face with long hair and full makeup will still look male to people and might trick the ai. But an androgynous/slight masculine face with a bit of makeup and longer haircut could make it pass as female to people and the ai.",
