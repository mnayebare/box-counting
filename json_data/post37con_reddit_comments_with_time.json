            "body": "Plenty of folks in the IT industry that have been jobless in the US for 6 months+ because of the hidden IT recession.  How about you hire those folks instead of more cheap IT workers out of other countries?  Or is it that you just don't want to pay them? And don't tell me nonsense that they need specialized workers for AI - I did 20 years in cybersecurity before moving over to AI systems development. There's plenty of talent here Google if you're willing to actually pay them.",

                    "body": "Google has uniform policies on pay bands and pays their H1B full time employees the same as everyone else, [averaging $386k/year](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/google/salaries/software-engineer?country=254) on a W2 for a senior software engineer. They don't save money hiring H1Bs, other than very abstract arguments about the broader labor market that assume that technology investment, what any economist would tell you is the very antithesis of a zero sum game, is zero sum.\n\nThe real reason they want H1Bs is that these fields are a direct competition over talent that is not a binary, but a continuum of capability with no hard upper bound. You will get really radically different outcomes in very new very highly technical applied research if you're able to staff the research org at the 95th percentile vs the 99.5th percentile vs the 99.95th percentile.\n\nThat's because the rate of progress the company can push in research is capped entirely by the rate at which the researchers can learn. There is no playbook to remember and apply. It's exploration of new problem spaces. And they are in a direct competition with other companies to be in front so they can capture market first. Whoever has the best people wins.\n\nThis is a big structural problem for the tech hiring in the US because intelligence is roughly evenly distributed around the world. Americans are not just way smarter than everyone else. And the number of people you have at the 99.95th percentile in a country is, well, 0.00005 times the population. So, given that the US is 350m/8b, we will only have about 5% of the people at any threshold in that competition born in the US.\n\nBut the US has historically killed it at technology precisely because it has had a very unique and enormous advantage at attracting the smartest people from the rest of the world to move here, first to come to the best universities in the world, and then to receive the highest pay for high skilled work in the world.\n\nAccordingly, if you walk around Google (or any top tech company) today, it is a very large number of immigrants, not just on h1b, but greencards, second gen citizens, especially from the largest countries in the world (India and China) which will naturally have a large number of outlier people just due to their size.\n\nChinese top talent increasingly stays in China as they are catching up and the language barrier is harder, Indian top talent increasingly goes to Europe because the greencards quota for them means they will die before they can get a green card, and thus they can't really build a life here.\n\nIf you think we're going to compete with chinese tech in 20 years with just native born Americans then you have not thought seriously about this problem at all.\n\n[The literal majority of US tech companies worth more than a billion dollars were founded or co-founded by first gen immigrants.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/07/26/most-us-billion-dollar-startups-have-an-immigrant-founder/?sh=5e41bcac6f3a). That same cohort has driven almost all of US economic growth since covid, so this isnt even just an issue within the industry.\n\n[40% of US nobel prize wins were first gen immigrants.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2023/10/05/immigrant-nobel-prize-winners-continue-to-impress/?sh=7424cb867394)\n\nThe entire bedrock of American tech success to date has been antithetical to the idea you are proposing, and diverging so radically from the strategy that has worked so well will, of course, cause a difference in outcomes.\n\nIt's just so annoying because american exceptionalists so often want to kill the thing at which america has been truly exceptional, attracting the smartest people in the world to join us. Americans ourselves are just normal people. The quality of our immigrants is what is so unique and the entire reason why we, as a country, are so good at science and technology.\n\nFor clarity, most lines in my family have been in the US long enough that we don't know where they're originally from. I'm not an immigrant at all. I just work (and thus hire) in this field.",

American CEOs are still making significantly more money than their counterparts in other countries. Why is no one asking why there's so much effin middle management? In my experience, the problem is that Americans have this obsession with money and then believe the narrative to trust poppa/Mama Bear corporate entities instead of your colleagues. Remember, you and your colleagues aren't too far off-base. So why wouldn't you share how much money you make with each other? Don't we all want to be properly compensated for our compounded years of knowledge? Listen, corporations are lined up to the teeth with all their lawyers and 'Human Resources' departmens 'to limit liability' and protect themselves from YOU in the event you lash out. CFOs don't care and majority make a million in a month (RSUs, RSOPs, stocks given to them with restrictions). We need H1Bs and American Born Children to compete. Competition is good for challenging each other, call it a necessary evil. What we need: better protections in place for the employee, a response to corporate greed to support and protect against corporations. There need to be people as experienced as a corporate shill, people to negotiate on the employee's behalf. I saw an union raise people's incomes randomly when looking at the difference between their colleagues. If everyone was paid the same, you wouldn't see competition either though. There's a balancing act to strike. Currently, we're not there..\n#TechUnions",

To stay competitive, we need talent. We don't have enough talent, and no, just because you're a mediocre IT professional with no background in AI who can't find a job doesn't mean we do. No, Google laying off a bunch of HR and back office people doesn't mean we do. If AI talent was so widely available, Zuck wouldn't be personally emailing Google's AI researchers to come work for Meta. \n\nAnd no, this isn't just Google \"looking for cheap labor.\" If it was, why wouldn't they just hire those researchers in the countries they're currently in? You think big bad evil corp who wants to pay people nothing wants to pay US engineer salaries? All you have to do is look at Google's, or any AI company's, careers website to understand these are jobs that pay well into the 6 figures, sometimes close to 7. Comments saying \"immigrant labor is cheaper\" is living in fantasy land where supply and demand apparently don't exist. \n\nEvery tech company submits comments like these because there are talented researchers who want to come work here and stay here but can't because our immigration system is broken and underfunded. Any cursory research into how many H1B applications were received vs. how many were processed will show you this. \n\nLook, love or hate Google, if America wants to win the AI race, they are one of the horses we have to bet on, along with companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity. They all are saying we need to make it easier for white collar talent to come here. Americans should want highly paid (read: bigly tax revenue) workers to come here and support America in the AI race.",

If they need the talent this bad then they have to attract them with the high pay it demands. If they're paying that kind of money, I imagine they want the researchers to be with the other researchers in the US where they're headquartered (or the UK if it's DeepMind). They can't do that if the immigration system is broken. That's in my post.\n\nAnd yeah, those jobs aren't AI jobs...again, it's in the post. Also keep in mind this company isn't just the CEO drawing org charts and writing job descriptions and doing hiring; it's 200,000 employees and something like hundreds of VPs that might make decisions independently. \n\nMy ultimate point is boiling this down to \"Google always bad\" isn't an accurate picture of reality. You can disagree with their approach but that's the truth is nuanced whether you want to believe it or not.",

That being said I've tried to give them my two cents thousands of times I've tried to help them evolve as best as I can and I could tell you out of the hundreds of emails that I've sent multiple streams of feedback I have never once in my entire life have gotten a response from Google. They know that they have no choice but to implement AI technology they also know that decentralization is being heavily adopted and they're going to have to drastically change their business practices to stay alive in the future. In my opinion they haven't really done shit in the past 5 years they're more focused on creating devices instead of focusing on what they're supposed to be doing which is software. There's certain technologies that they have that needs a whole lot of work for example Google Maps or Google's voice to text. These are two applications that direly need AI implementation since they're not going to use Manpower to evolve these apps fast enough. I cannot remember a time in the past 2 years that I've successfully been able to use Google maps without any problems or been able to use Google's voice to text for even a paragraph without having to edit it. Google lay down a lot of Foundations that being said we need other protocols and apps for services that Google has a conglomerate for.",
