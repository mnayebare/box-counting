I do not think that they have a competitive LLM cooked up and ready for the public. OpenAI/Nvidia kind of changed the playing field for everyone in a way that made people rethink how they were trying accomplish AI. I think Apple will probably leverage them in the short term to hold them over until their own LLMs are ready. GPT is amazing at context. Siri sucks at context and understanding it\u2019s so bad that if they had something better they would have fixed it by now. \n\nI think there will 1 or 2 features the public will see as definitely GPT but behind the scenes a lot more that we don\u2019t. Apple isn\u2019t one to release something worse than the competition. They have a reputation of being late but best in implementation. If they don\u2019t have a LLM that can do what they need yet they will get the best and leverage it to fill in the gaps until it is.",

Capable of running on an iPhone and without an internet connection, the new Siri impressed people with its improved speed, conversational capabilities and the accuracy with which it understood user commands. Code-named Project Blackbird, the effort also imagined a Siri with capabilities built by third-party app developers, according to people familiar with the work.\n\nYet a competing project won out in an internal contest ahead of the 10-year anniversary of Siri\u2019s launch. Known as Siri X, the more-modest upgrade involved moving more existing Siri software onto iPhones from remote servers to improve the voice assistant\u2019s speed and privacy. The Siri X enhancement was unveiled in 2021.\n\nNext week, at Apple\u2019s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, the company is set to join an AI arms race that many think will define the future of technology. The iPhone maker is trying to catch up with Microsoft, Alphabet\u2019s Google and other rivals that have begun to integrate generative AI into their core products.\n\nApple\u2019s caution and characteristic secrecy, as well as the care it takes in upgrading devices\u2014where hardware and software are seamlessly integrated\u2014have hobbled its early efforts in the AI arena, the people said. It now finds itself in the unusual position of having to take risks.\n\nThe company is set to announce an array of generative-AI upgrades to its software products, including Siri, said people familiar with its plans. The AI features include assistance in message writing, photo editing and summarizing texts.\n\nWhile Apple isn\u2019t expected to catch up with leading AI innovators soon, the company is preparing to unveil AI features with impressive capabilities that also maximize privacy for users\u2014a concern that will be central to unlocking the full potential of AI assistants. Apple is also expected to unveil one or more potential partnerships with major AI developers after holding talks with OpenAI, Google and Cohere, the people said. \n\nApple has long prided itself on perfection in its product rollouts, a near impossibility with emerging AI models. While OpenAI systems have dazzled more than 180 million users with their generation of writing, images and video, they are prone to occasional errors, often called hallucinations. Apple has had limited tolerance for such issues.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as 100% accuracy with AI, that\u2019s the fundamental reality,\u201d said Pedro Domingos, a professor emeritus of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington. \u201cApple is not compatible with that. They won\u2019t release something until it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nApple has weighed whether to allow users to choose a third-party AI provider that could supplant or help power Siri, one of the people said. It is unclear in what way Siri could be powered, augmented or replaced by third-party AI providers, or whether Apple will move forward with a version of that idea. \n\nBloomberg earlier reported on an OpenAI partnership, and The Information reported on efforts to overhaul Siri.\nGoogle, Microsoft and Samsung Electronics have begun rapidly integrating generative AI into their devices and services. While Apple finds itself behind in a generational shift taking place in the tech industry, many investors and AI experts have said the company will find a way to bring generative AI to the masses.\n\n\u201cApple can do pretty much anything they set their minds to,\u201d said Vineet Khosla, a former engineering manager on the Siri team who is currently chief technology officer at the Washington Post. \u201cThere is a consumer focus that exists at the company. The focus of their AI is to make it work in a very privacy-sensitive manner.\u201d \n\nOver the years, Apple has made improvements to Siri and incorporated smaller AI features throughout all of its products. In the recently released headset Vision Pro, AI is extensively used for tracking eyes and hand positions.\n\nWhen Siri launched in 2011, Apple was ahead of rivals in seeking to establish the first AI assistant. Jobs, who spearheaded the acquisition in 2010 that led to Siri, encouraged the team to keep the assistant\u2019s dry wit and sense of humor. The early launch demonstrated the company\u2019s willingness to take risks.\n\n\u201cSiri was the last thing Apple was first on,\u201d said Dag Kittlaus, co-founder of the Siri startup that Apple bought, who left Apple soon after the product\u2019s launch. \n\nAs Apple struggled to keep advancing Siri, the company hired one of Google\u2019s top engineering executives to run its AI strategy: John Giannandrea. In 2018, he was elevated to the role of senior vice president, reporting directly to Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.\n\nIn early team meetings, Giannandrea made it clear that improving Siri was a main focus. He was also tasked with centralizing much of Apple\u2019s fragmented efforts regarding AI. He began building up his AI team by recruiting Google employees and through startup acquisitions, but his team had difficulty fitting in with the rest of Apple, according to people familiar with their work.\n\nThe new AI group operated much like parts of Google, where deadlines are more loosely defined. Teams inside Apple need to maintain rigorous deadlines to have products ready for major release events every fall. Efforts to collaborate between other parts of Apple that were building products and the AI team at times fell apart because they couldn\u2019t agree on deadlines, the people said.\n\nInstead of working with the AI team, other parts of Apple busy building software products maintained their own, separate AI capabilities. For example, the software group run by Senior Vice President Craig Federighi continued to invest in and build up the AI behind its image- and video-recognition capabilities, said former Apple employees.\n\nAnother big limiting factor for Giannandrea\u2019s AI team was the lack of access to computing resources, said former executives and engineers. Compared with rivals, Apple in recent years has secured fewer chips known as graphical-processing units that are essential for training AI models, said people familiar with Apple\u2019s internal infrastructure.\n\nMuch of the AI team had to rely on external cloud services\u2014Google\u2019s cloud was preferred by many of the former Google employees on Giannandrea\u2019s team\u2014to train their AI models, the people said.\n\nWhen ChatGPT launched in late 2022, everything changed. Federighi, the software chief, became a convert that Christmas break after he began playing around with the Microsoft-owned GitHub AI coding tool called Copilot, which is powered by OpenAI\u2019s technology, said people familiar with his experience.\n\nAfter that moment, across Federighi\u2019s software-engineering organization, employees were tasked with coming up with new ways of incorporating generative AI into products and given resources to pursue these projects, said former executives and engineers. At internal meetings, Federighi said that he had come to appreciate generative AI technology and that it would be incorporated into all aspects of Apple\u2019s software.\n\nApple stepped up efforts to build its own internal generative AI. In February, the company canceled its decadeslong effort to build its own electric car. Some of the employees had been redeployed into these generative AI projects.\nSome of the new features and updates Apple is expected to announce this year will be powered by Apple\u2019s internally built generative AI models, but Apple has been looking at potential external partnerships for more advanced AI. Giannandrea and Federighi have met with Sam Altman, OpenAI\u2019s chief executive officer, said people familiar with the discussions.\n\nWith a new urgency on AI technology, Kittlaus, the Siri co-founder, said this year could be an important one for Siri as the company plans to incorporate thoughtful AI features into the iPhone. \u201cSiri has been stuck in the mud for years,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I absolutely see a renaissance coming.\u201d",

            "body": "Apparently they only got truly hooked once Craig played with Copilot as a _released product_ - a custom fine tuned model based on Microsoft's multiyear partnership with OpenAI that eventually generated GPT-4. That tells a thing or two just how far behind they are. They utterly and compleletely missed the train as they dicked around with their glasses.\n\nBut I also think that while I don't see AI as a straight up bubble, I think _a lot_ of users, even enthusiasts, haven't yet come to terms with that hallucinations and misinformation _will_ be a problem because we don't have a solution. The solution doesn't lie in the training data or the model size, but wholly new paradigms in training an AI that is probably not GPT based.\n\nI think it's like to 30% a bubble, because of course many applications exist, but I think we still have this perception that AI will eventually go AGI but we have nothing indicating this yet. To the contrary, open efforts like Llama 3 are catching up even with the elite models and so going proprietary and making a business model out of providing access to your LLM seems more like a failing one by the day, _and_ also hallucinations and misinformation is an unsolved problem, _also_ makin large scale services like augmented Google Search a tough sell.\n\nThe path towards profit via AI isn't really in \"hey we have an AI you can talk to, it knows everything\" in my opinion (because it doesn't and it fails too often - a mere 5% hallucination risk is every 20 questions!). It's rather by speeding up software development, prototyping and sketching in engineering applications, quickly providing marketing material, etc.\n\nSo, being cautious here to only launch wide once a technology is perfected would be typical Apple and I wouldn't be surprised if we have only \"mild\" AI in iOS 18 (like webpage summaries) even if they could do more if aggressive. But being aggressive brings about the aforementioned failure rate and unsolved problems that Google apparently dove headfirst into, and Apple doesn't want that. They may do it (get hallucinations etc) but then by accident because Apple isn't that kind of company. They put their brand above all.",

Before LLM, 100M parameters model was already considered overkill for many tasks, now 1B LLM is just some random small model.

What Apple missed is LLM and its multimodal capabilities.\u00a0\"\n\n  \nThat is why Apple is in an even better position than most companies, because what they didn't do is rely heavily on the one form of AI that outright lies.\n\nI have tried to use LLMs off and on for various things, because they simply make up stuff at random it makes trying to use them for anything of substance almost pointless, since you have to double-check every single aspect of the output.\n\nSo where exactly SHOULD Apple have put LLMs?  Replacing Siri, so it could make up responses and claim it was 70 and sunny out when it was raining and 50?  \n\nAnd the thing is the \"neural\" chips Apple has are flexible enough they can run an LLM - where they make sense.  But the thing is, I have yet to see a case where they actually are very useful at all.  Even the proponents are trying hard to fix the hallucinatory nature of the LLM...  some by creating general purpose AIs to check facts.  But if you really develop an AGI why use an LLM at all?",
