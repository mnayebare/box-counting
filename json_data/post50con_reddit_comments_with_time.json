The solution is to make sure that none of the information contains enough unique pieces of data to trace it back to a single person with any confidence. Race, geographic origin, and other forms of demographic info are extremely important in this context, and having an algorithm that could suddenly link race to images in these large datasets could raise all sorts of privacy concerns. \n\nI know it doesn\u2019t sound like a single data point like race would matter much if an image has been supposedly anonymized, but there is a ton of math and complexity behind the scenes with these things. Doesn\u2019t take much to cause big problems sometimes.",

Training data: If the data an algorithm is analyzing is of a fundamentally different type than the data it was trained on, it's prone to failure. When analyzing data specific to one demographic group, the algorithm should be trained specifically to analyze data from that group.\n\n2. Diagnosis based on demographic instead of symptoms/physical condition: If one demographic has a higher prevalence of a condition, you want to control for that in a diagnostic algorithm. To use a rudimentary example, it's not helpful to me for an algorithm to say \"you're at 50% greater risk for testicular cancer\" just because the algorithm notices I have testicles, which half of the training data subjects didn't.\n\nThere are far more nuances to consider, too.

There are plenty of areas we can note that have blind spots.

While in black people 4 toes indicates an 80% risk of lung cancer. Last condition, we make up a specific human bias involving race, all doctors are racist so 90% of the time they cut corners and fail to diagnose black people, while only 10% of the time they fail with white people.\n\nNow we feed that Data to an AI and ask it to diagnose people with 4 toes. We dont want to bias our precious robot with racism so we dont even mention race to it. We just feed it raw data. Well what does the raw data tell it? When people have 4 toes 72% of the time they have brain cancer, 8% they have lung cancer, and 20% should be tested again because they are probably cancer free but a second test will avoid misses.\n\nNow a black person walks in with 4 toes. The AI buzzes and whizzes for a minute then confidently prints out the results that didn't even consider race because he's a robot and isn't racist. You have brain cancer. Start treatment.\n\nI know your point is \"well arent we smart enough to tell the AI, hey pay attention to race to more accurately diagnose\". For example if the robot knew the guy with 4 toes was black couldnt it have realized he had lung cancer?\n\nSure, if you can effectively identify and account for all of the racial bias in your original data. Real cancer isnt as obvious as 4 toes, black or white and real doctors arent all racist. Good luck showing the robot when race is important and when it isnt. Also showing it when people were racist and when they werent. When society was racist so people got worse care due to economics, and when it wasnt. Not only figuring out exactly all the times when patient race influenced outcomes but also HOW it influenced them. \n\nNothing's impossible, but an AI that has bias input which reduces it's ability and creates a bias but ALSO can idlentify race opening the door for us to further bias the interpretation of data is a bit of a pickle.",

There is \\*tons\\* of racially motivated (and stastically inaccurate) bias in medicine.\n\nFor example, in California it was noticed that black women who were giving birth were like 10x more likely to die during pregnancy, and most of the time the cause was blood-loss. So they started requiring that the sponges being used to clean the blood had to be weighed on the spot, to remove the doctors/nurses biases about how much blood the woman had/had not lost, which almost immediately cut the maternal mortality rate (while still in the hospital anyways) for black women in half.\n\nNow what happens if you feed the pre-policy-change data to an AI? Well it's likely to infer that (because doctors didn't do anything to stop it) blood loss in black women giving birth isn't a major concern, and so in it's ability to detect someones race via whatever unknown means it will 'decide' wether or not blood-loss is a thing it should care about. Doctors relying on it to give them accurate information, but who have their own internal biases, are going to continue to miss the bloodloss, and black women are going to continue to die.\n\nThis sort of thing happens \\*all the time\\* in both medicine (biased medical staff not listening to black people or taking their issues as seriously) and AI (it figuring out unintended ways to 'win' whatever task has been put in front of it,) combining these to biases into 1 diagnostic tool is a hilariously bad idea.",

That is, you have a data based model that will get a pixelated picture and then it adds features on it based on the data it was fed.  \n\nIn the original article, we have a classifier network, that tries to determine the bucket where this data belongs to based on the data it has seen before.  \n\n\nAuto generative networks are extremely sensitive to training data bias. Feeding more training images of white males than black males will result in images which look more like white males even if the input data you are trying to give it is actually 50/50.  \n\nClassifiers on the other hand, are a lot less sensitive to input data bias. What classifiers do is they get pre-determined buckets (like white male, black male, white female, black female) and then they are trained to assign the input data into those buckets. The network will give out probabilities that the input put data belongs to each bucket and then the maximum of those is used for the answer.  \n\nTherefore, even if you have some bias in the input data (say, more X-ray images of white males than black males) it means the network can more confidently say \"this is not a white male and definitely not a female\" so it would return \"black male\" (assuming we had only 4 buckets).",

I noticed that they're all super light skinned and the white versions of them don't have much skin color difference. Maybe the AI is only able to recognize a race when the skin color is more distinct and common to the race. It would be based off of samples that was given to the AI, I guess the creator had chosen darker skinned black people as the sample, maybe to make things easy on the AI, or maybe because of the creators idea of how certain people of certain races look (probably what happened). Being given a larger sample with more variation, the AI would be able to learn. Idk if you can immediately say that the creator was exhibiting a racial bias without more information, like I said maybe started with a small sample size and chose distinctly different looking people to help the AI function properly... \n\nWhich doesn't detract from the obvious, that people would for sure imbue the AI with their existing biases, racial or otherwise, and the AI will then carry on with the information it's been given. In a medical setting that could be disastrous, because there has been huge racial discrimination in medicine for a long time (like the black women dying in pregnancy because doctors thought they were more resistant to pain, or was it that they weren't showing pain in the same way a white woman was? I don't remember. ) In that situation, an AI could've been taught that the black woman doesn't need care as immediately as the white woman because it was taught that black women resist pain, put the white woman higher up on the care roster, and ending up perpetuating our existing biases etc",

You can easily imagine an AI that is being trained to flag a feature in the X-ray as 'concerning' or 'not concerning'. But if the diagnosis data it is trained on is racially biased (like if certain races' potential problems were more likely to be dismissed by doctors as not concerning) AND the AI is capable of grouping skeletons by racial categories, then the AI might decide that a good 'shortcut' for reproducing the diagnosis data is to blow off issues that it sees in skeletons that fit a certain racial pattern.\n\nAnd since these machine learning algorithms are basically black boxes without doing a ton of careful examination, you would likely never know that it has landed on this particular 'shortcut'.\n\nIt would be just like the problems they've had with training AIs to sort through resumes. The AI quickly figures out that in order to reproduce human hiring decisions it should avoid people with certain kinds of names rather than judge purely off the resume. Just replace names with skeleton shapes and the resumes with what's actually good/bad on the X-ray.\n\nThis X-ray thing is actually worse than the resumes, because you can take the names off the resumes and hope that improves things, but you can't really take the skeleton shape out of the... skeleton.",

The reason it's worrying, and the reason it's being brought up as a case study here (and in most programing courses) is because we'd very much like our computers to stop being racist. That's really hard to do, and it takes a fuck load of time pruning datasets incredibly carefully in order to stop, so the fact that this medical AI is begining to exhibit similar tendencies is worrying to the researchers because it might mean years more of pouring over spreadsheets to eradicate the underlying racial biases.\n\nSo it's both doing as it's told and also failing at it's job because the researchers failed at theirs.

What else *could* you do? It needs some kind of baseline reference in order to \"learn\".\n\nAIs literally just mimic established datasets, that's what 'AI' is. When people say they 'trained' an AI, they just mean they gave it a large dataset of already-classified data and it found a bunch of statistical patterns, which it can then use to classify new data.\n\nThere's no way to train an AI to give diagnoses without giving it a bunch of human-made diagnoses as a baseline.\n\nThis is part of why a lot of scientists hate that the name 'AI' got popular for these algorithms, because they're really just very fancy curve-fitting and the name misleads people who don't know how they work. There's not really anything more 'intelligent' about an AI than there is about the least-squares fit function on a graphing calculator. Neural nets and such are just elaborate and successful types of curve-fitting for large high-dimensional data sets.",

And there could be many different causes as to why that bias exists, but the root of the problem is misdiagnosing a whole group of people.\n\nIs it possible? Yeah for sure. If the training data doesn't have a good representation of people, it might accidentally learn racial traits as traits for diagnoses, even if those traits aren't *actually* correlated.\n\nHypotheticals are easier to explain/understand, so let's suppose researchers were training an AI to detect a disease. They need to first make data sets to train with.\n\nSo, the researchers create a dataset for \"healthy\" individuals. The \"healthy\" population was a good dataset with lots of diversity. But then, in trying to create a dataset for \"diseased\" individuals, they really didn't have any good images of people with a background of XYZ. What if they train the AI on the data anyways? \n\nSo they train the model on these datasets. And the results look very good. All of the training data sets give correct predictions! So they package it up and it goes to clinical use. And someone with XYZ traits gets misdiagnosed as \"healthy\". Actually, most people with XYZ traits get the \"healthy\" diagnoses despite having the disease.\n\nWell, during training, the AI decided that people with XYZ traits tend to be healthy. And since there are fewer examples of XYZ people in the \"diseased\" dataset, the AI sees this as a perfectly valid feature to focus on. Because as far as it is concerned, XYZ people are almost always healthy. It saw a shortcut and used it, because it wasn't trained against it.",

The real headline of this story should be \"Harder to blind models to existing bias than previously thought because ML is so fucking good at detecting any patterns in data.\"\n\nSuppose we were setting out to design an ML model to aid in sentencing for criminal offenses. You plug in some details about the case and get back a guideline about what standard sentencing would be - how many hours of community service or years in jail would be recommended. In a lot of ways this sounds like a great idea! You can help judges reference hundreds of thousands of cases establishing pretty concrete precedence to decrease variance across judges, counties, or states  based on things like the severity of the crime, whether the perpetrator is a repeat offender, the age of the victim, etc.\n\nSo you build an AI and train it on existing data from the your judicial system. Because you want to get the most accurate results you throw in all the data from your data set as features. Then when you're testing it, you realize that for some reason it's recommending longer sentences for black people than white people for the same crime and circumstances. You smack yourself in the forehead and realize that because judges can (and often do) exhibit bias in sentencing, by training the neural net on data from real cases, and plugging in the race of the perpetrator as a feature in your training, you've essentially replicated the judges' biases into your ml model. Because machine learning is exceptionally good at detecting patterns, it has detected and incorporated this very real pattern into its recommendations.\n\nYou scrap your first try and remove that feature from your training. No longer will the AI be told the race of the perpetrator (or victim). You still keep all the other data and retrain your model. But when you test it, you get the same biased results! What's going on? Well... Maybe you kept in area code, or perpetrator names, or even a document vectored model of the perp's confession, all of which can theoretically be correlated with race. Because that correlation exists and because ML finds ***all*** the patterns, even though you removed race as a feature of your training data, the AI still absorbs and reflects the biases from the data that come from the human judges' biases.\n\nAll of the data that you feed in is truly objective - in that it really happened and is accurately recorded and used to train the model - but if there's any potential for subjectivity in the data you're extrapolating from, then it's magnified by machine learning even if you try to hide it. Detection of race from skeletal scans is a reminder that features can be correlated to biased metrics, even when not explicitly included (like the area code vs race feature).\n\nAnd there are plenty of vectors for subjectivity in the medical field. Amounts of pain medication prescribed, time from reported symptoms to diagnosis, who to prioritize/what urgency to assign patients if care is limited (triage). Hell, even the detection of various diseases at all can depend on access to insurance which can, in some cases, be correlated with race.\n\nOr maybe the patterns aren't subjective if you had a perfect dataset, but the data collection is biased in some way: Perhaps all the indicators of a particular disease are strongly correlated with white people because they make up 95% of your dataset because the hospital you got the data from just happens to be in a white neighborhood. So then the ML picks up on this correlation (maybe from bone scans) that has nothing to do with actual causation and misdiagnoses every black patient you try to use it on.\n\nLike I said in my previous comment, I don't think anyone's worried about the ability to predict race from skeletons. That's not the actual headline here.",

I would say that this is the same problem that we already face in research studies, just in a new format.\n\nLike studies that we're more accustomed to, there needs to be an appropriate level of consideration towards the subjects being researched, whether the subjects are data points or human individuals.  The method in which the subjects are selected is a basic feature of a scientific article, which provides a level of transparency that can help a reader recognize bias in the selection process OR a lack of consideration or thoughtfulness.\n\nAt the end of the day, if these studies can be replicated in peer reviewed studies with different data sets, this would increase the credibility of the results as well as weed out potential bias.",

                            "body": "I think the concern is that racial differences can alter data in subtle ways. For example I read a study where an AI was less likely to recommend an intensive treatment for black/minority patients at any given level of disease burden, even when such treatment was warranted. The issue with the algorithm turned out to be in the training data. Black/minority patients were less likely to spend money on future healthcare, perhaps due to being unable to afford care or from having negative experiences. The issue is that the AI had been trained to use healthcare SPENDING as a way to measure health. More spending in the AI mind meant worse health. Wealthy white patients spent more money on healthcare, so the AI judged them to be unhealthier and therefore allocated more intense treatment to them. Minority patients avoided future healthcare spending, so the AI thought that meant they were healthier. The AI was using race as a health predictor without understanding the socioeconomic context. Essentially, the program had been taught using biases data so it made biased decision. Learning algorithms make predictions based on data, but they don\u2019t \u201cunderstand\u201d the data or it\u2019s meaning. Race correlates with many, many things, so it\u2019s a dangerous data point for an AI to have. As you\u2019ve said, it can also be a really useful tool when diseases vary with race, but race probably needs to be something that AIs employ meaningfully and with the foreknowledge of clinicians and researchers.",

Secretary Clarke denied this accusation saying, 'the fact that 2/3rds of all passengers selected for additional screening were of Arab ethnicity is coincidental and not the result of a intentional plan of discrimination.'\n\n*the next day*\n\n Amazingly the same Anchor:\n\n'shocking revelations in a congressional hearing today as TSA scanning whistle blower Todd Howard testified, 'It's my understanding Senator that the AI was simply instructed to ignore certain passengers and send others for additional screening.'

Denisovan ancestors, Neanderthal, etc. As in some regions have 3% of this, some 7% of that, some 0% of neither. That's a lot of DNA variation. Which is fine really.\n\nWe are also finding more and more that specific genetic markers can heavily impact things such as violence/social interactions. Whether they are turn on/off, present/missing, etc.\n\nSo if you remove the human side of things, the emotional side, the side that connects us as a society and instead go on a machines raw logic it could be problematic. \n\nRemember humans themselves work off pattern recognition as well as tribalism and it leads to issues that are still causing strife in society today and probably always will.

It's happened before, and can be done both by accident and design. \n\nYour local neighborhood home prices and crime rates are both positively correlated to race, so if a bank uses these in deciding to give you a home loan, which sounds superficially very reasonable, they are generating racial discrimination on the fly. Your race can't get loans and can't get to better statistics as a result and so continue to be denied loans. \n\nWhether your parents have a college degree is correlated to race. So if a bank is deciding to give you a student loan, and they use your parent's education as a factor, say as an indicator of ability to complete the school, then once again: racial discrimination is now implicit in this act. You get denied a loan, can't get your degree, so neither can your descendants. \n\nSo in this case imagine your health insurance is tied to your current health. Say they use x-rays to evaluate the health of your skeleton or something, to evaluate risks of breakage etc, or decide if they approve/deny your claim. But since this apparently is enough to detect race, you now have a (hidden) proxy for race, and using it can exacerbate racial discrimination despite any attempts to avoid it entirely. Your claim may get denied because race is correlated with getting denied, and the xray tells them that without ever having to make it explicit at any stage.",

Neither are true of course, but whatever subtle differences there are between groups is useful to know because we can exploit this knowledge to enhance our lives. And by \u201cour\u201d I mean everyone. It\u2019s a shame to see sometimes people put their vision for the way things aught to be ahead of the way things are. This impulse has lead to a fair few reckless choices in the world - anti-nuclear being the one that comes to mind the quickest for me.\n\nWhatever\u2019s true, I want to know. Whether people should be judged as individuals, but treated equally at first meeting, Is not up for debate imo. Everything else is up for grabs",

We aren't programming it with \"All humans have the same rights to respect and quality of treatment.\" They learn by merely getting \"trained\" through examining datasets and identifying commonalities. We don't usually understand *what* they are identifying, just the end result.\n\nSo, in the case of the AI identifying race via X-ray, that might seem innocuous and a \"huh, that's interesting\" moment, but it could lead to problems down the road because we don't control the associations it makes. If you feed it current treatment plans which *are* subject to human biases, you could get problematic results. If African Americans are less likely to be believed about pain, for example, they'll get prescribed less medication to manage it. If the AI identifies them as African American through an X-ray, then it might also recommend no pain management medication even though there is evidence of disc issues in the X-ray, because it has created a spurious correlation between people with whatever features it's recognizing being prescribed less pain medication.\n\nIn a case like that a supposedly \"objective\" AI will have been trained by a biased dataset and inherited those biases, and we may not have a way to really detect or fix it in the programming. This is the danger inherent in such AI training, and something we need to solve for or else we risk perpetuating the same biases and incorrect diagnoses we created the AI to get away from. If we are training them and essentially allowing them to teach themselves, we have little control over the conclusions they draw, but frequently trust them to be objective because \"Well it's a computer, it can't be biased.\"",

In a future society they had created surgical robots that were considered better and more accurate than human surgeons because they don't make mistakes. At one point, a man wakes up during surgery, which is something that occasionally happens with anesthesia, and the robots do not stop the surgery and the man dies of shock.\n\nThe main character, a surgeon, comments even that the surgical procedure is *flawless*, but that the death was caused by something outside of their programming, but something that a human surgeon would have recognized and been able to deal with. I believe the resolution was the robots working in conjunction with human doctors, rather than being treated as utterly infallible.\n\nIt's a bit different in that it's more of a \"robots are too cold and miss that special something humans have\" but does touch on a similar thing of how we don't always understand how our machines are programmed. This was an unanticipated issue, and it was not noticed because it was assumed that the robots were infallible. Therefore, objectively, they acted correctly and the patient died because sometimes people die in surgery, right? It was the belief in their objectivity that led to this failing, the belief that they would make the *right* decision in every scenario, because they did not have human biases and fragility.",

How do you make that determination? What about a cat vs a dog, or a chicken vs a hawk? \n\nWe trust that other humans are capable of making those determinations because I can show you a picture of my dog and you'll say \"Oh, what a nice dog.\" I have zero idea of how you decided that it was a dog though, and your thoughts are a black box to me. Did you make that determination based on nose shape? Muzzle length? Iris shape? Fur texture? All I care about are the results and if they agree with mine, the methodology doesn't really matter nor is it knowable because if asked you would likely say \"I dunno, it just looks like a dog to me.\"\n\nThis is much like how we train our AIs. Can it identify a dog 99.9% of the time? If so, great AI! For all we know though, it made that determination based on the angle that the shot was taken from, because for some unknown reason the pictures it encountered had some commonalities of shot composition. Like with other people though, we test on result and if it agrees with our predictions, and don't understand the methodology. There can be no \"data log\" just like how you likely cannot articulate the vast degree of correlations and pattern matching your brain went through to come at the \"Oh, what a nice dog\" conclusion, and even if there was, it could very likely be completely different for separately trained AIs, even if they come to the same conclusions in testing.",

As an example, I admin a Facebook group dedicated to a certain game, and have had issues with some comments being automatically flagged by Facebook's moderation algorithms. \n\nNamely, someone described how to attack a boss, and it was flagged and removed for violent rhetoric, as if they were advocating for attacking a human being. It could detect comment phrases, but had no nuance or context, and without a way to report back that this was incorrect, there's no real way to correct the issue.\n\nNow, I don't know if this is a dumb algorithm or a low complex AI, but it is one that's out in the wild and suffers from the issues I described. I know it's more complex that a simple word search, because many comments with similar wording were *not* flagged, but I'm unable to figure out exactly what caused it to create an association that necessitated removing the comment.\n\n>This is literally an article about an issue being detected and we absolutely can fix the programming, models can be retrained, data can be adjusted to remove biases, the base code of the AI world is very open source.\n\nTo clarify, I mean that we often can't point to say, a line of code and say \"Ah, here's the conclusion it drew, and by changing this variable to a 3, we will correct the problem.\" We can detect errors when results do not match expectations, and we can begin the training process again, or use a different dataset to adjust its conclusions, but we can't correct it as simply as we can other errors. In Dark Souls 2, for example, there was a bug where weapons were degrading much faster than intended, and it was caused by the game using frames in checking it such that higher framerates causes faster degradation because it was counting each frame as a separate instance of durability loss. The bug was corrected by adjusting the code to use either a static value or some other variable that returned it to expected values.\n\nRegardless, if we're making improvements to AI to better understand how they come to their conclusions and get away from black box designs, then that's a good thing.",

So the issues with facebooks moderation algorithms are not problems with the AI, but instead an issue with politics and history and people.\n\nTraining an AI to get the above issue you described right is basically trivial, just yesterday I wrote a text classification model with 99.86% accuracy, and i trained it in 20 minutes, facebooks deep learning models have a different challenge to face though, not just \"what was said\" but \"who said it, and do they have a history of being flagged for innapropriate content\",  secondly, they have a model which is not optimised for accuracy, it is optimised to reduce risk exposure to the business at the same time as minimising impact on profits/attention economy metrics. The problem with your facebook group example isnt that we cant do the AI right, its that the goal of the AI that has actually been trained is not aligned with the assumption of what it should be doing (accurately identifying content to be removed), facebook have a dollar cost model of how mucb each % in accuracy will cost them, and this is calculated against the potential cost to their business in lawsuits, lost user usage time and PR costs, it will be very finely tuned to address that on an ongoing basis.\n\n>that we often can't point to say, a line of code and say \"Ah, here's the conclusion it drew, and by changing this variable to a 3, we will correct the problem.\"\n\nWell, yes and no, you should undersratand that many models these days are literally one line of code, much of the extra code is actually there to load, unload, transform the data ready for training, so youre right in as much as you cant point to a line of code because generally speaking, there isnt a line of code to point at.\n\nWhere you are wrong is that generally, we can usually identify what the issue is, most models are in some way \"clustering\" algorithms, and we have a good idea of where they go wrong, what we do is run the model over the data a d compare those lines with the preicted result and look for conflicts, i.e. shouldve been true but predicted false or shouldve been false but predicted true, most of the time we can pretty quickly figure out what \"feature\" is different and making it an outlier compared to the rest of the dataset, it can be a challenge when its multiple features that are all slightly out of whack, for instance with your facebook example if they used a smart apostrophe instead of a straight apostrophe while also using passive voice and making a typo while also using a slangword thats innocuous. But most of the time, that is pretty rare.\n\nI think from a non experts point of view, it can be hard to get your head around because it seems like _AI is code_, but it isnt, there are no lines of if and then statements or code actually being implemented in the AI itself, the code is simply a method of using the AI, its a bit like Magrittes \"Ceci n'est pas une pipe\", the AI is actually _maths_, it just that generally, most programmers hate maths (most people actually!) And the people who built the AI have worked really hard to make it so you dont have to think about the maths going on under the hood.\n\nMost of these articles arent actually about the AI, and are rarely written by those actually creating AI itself, it is generally written by people with an agenda (not necessarily a bad one!), for instance ACLU wrote TONNES of articles about amazons face recognition being racist, but it wasnt, ACLU were just turning down the accuracy setting and then presenting it as if amazons AI was getting it wrong, as opposed to them deliberately using it incorrectly.\n\nBut that was the point, if ACLU could use it incorrectly, then so could the police, and if facial recognition was going to be used in court as potential evisence it better not be so easily misused. ACLU did a good things but they lied to achieve their goals because the actual issues with the tech are too complicated to communicate most of the time, and it being used racistly was a thing people could understand and an issue they could get behind. \n\nThe above article is much the same, mostly a complete fabrication, with tiny hints of truth poking through, but it is being used to address the issue that AI is being used more and more in medtech, and that is potentially something the public needs to be aware of and have input on, which they currently arent.",

You typically have input data, a series of neural net layers where each node is connected to every node of the adjacent layers, then outputs, and you teach it which neural network configuration most reliably translates the input data into the output result that is correct (this is a mixture of trial and error and analysing R (measure of accuracy) trends to push the system towards greater accuracy as training goes on).    \nAnyway, in a purely diagnostic system like this, the issue with bad data would just be diagnostic inaccuracy, and result from either limited datasets or technical issues (like dark skin being harder to process from photos). It's not like the system is going to literally start treating black people badly, but they would have a worse outcome from it theoretically.",

The 'classic' way of doing facial recognition is to look for the shadows the forehead casts on the eyes. It's just looking for two dark patches in a lighter oval with an even lighter line down the middle for the nose. Obviously that's much more difficult to detect when the face is dark all over. Using AI is actually how this apparent racism was overcome. \n\nOf course an AI based facial recognition algorithm will also be racist if it was trained on only one race, but that's true of all AI in that it takes on the biases of its training data.",

So you feed this large data set to the AI of x-rays of people's chests and ask it to diagnosis whether or not they have lung cancer. and it does so-- including catching diagnosis that were missed by human doctors. Except, for black people, it inexplicitly decides to include race as a diagnostic criteria. As in, it sees the cancer, but because the data you fed it indicates that black people shouldn't be diagnosed with cancer, it decides to return a diagnosis of 'not cancer'.  \n\nThis is, obviously, an undesired outcome. \n\nThe problem of course is that in order to train the AI, you have to get it the best dataset possible, but the real world data is inherently flawed. So, researchers are attempting to scrub that sort of identifying information from the data before it's fed into the machine.

In order to train it to look for stage one in patients that are \"racially\" less likely to get it (or substitute whatever diagnosis fits) you have to let it train on that subset, as well as others. Eventually it will spot it in every subset, *and....* Place it in the appropriate subset, as I mentioned, without you wanting it to. Simply because it will. Categorizing is what AI does best.",

Text AI's will say racist things straight from 4chan\n\nCompletely different problem than described here, and an entirely different type of AI. What you're describing was Tay, an internet chatbot designed to learn from Twitter. Once 4chan hears about that, of course its going to be saying racist shit within a day.\n\n>Image Classification has a Gorilla problem that most have put off for now. \n\nThe \"Gorilla problem\", for those who don't know is a \"problem\" OpenAI found in their data where there was a classification category that would activate for both black people and sometimes, gorillas. Heres the thing though: the only racism here is seeing this and saying \"IT DOES THAT BECAUSE MAYBE IT LEARNED THE RACIST THOUGHT THAT BLACKS ARE GORILLA-LIKE\", rather than coming to the more logical conclusion that just maybe these specific neurons have learned to activate for humanoid-like beings with black skin. If you dig deep enough I'm sure you'd be able to find a neuron that activates for white people and some white-skinned ape or other kind of animal too. Unless you're specifically including racist propaganda like a label that says \"black people look like gorillas\" in your training data this really shouldn't be a concern (not that this is never the case, but it would just mean that the AI engineers have completely fucked up the way they collected training data). What really is problematic here is the way the AI outputs are interpreted by people which brings us to:\n\n>The court sentencing ones suggest higher sentences for black people.\n\nThis right here is the real concern. If you train an AI on data that's racist, then the outputs will be racist too. That's what we call \"garbage in, garbage out\". We know that (in western culture, at least) black people and other minorities get arrested disproportionately compared to whites. We also know that because of systemic racism keeping black people in a lower economic class, they are more likely to commit crimes like theft or selling drugs. These are the things that an AI picks up on when you give it all available information. So if you want it to predict whether or not a human would arrest and convict someone (which is completely different to \" SHOULD they be arrested/convicted), it is no surprise that it too will say that black people will be convicted disproportionally.\n\nWe shouldn't make a system that tries to predict whether or not you're guilty based on external circumstances that could lead to knowing ones race in the first place; so no data about their name, medical history, neighborhood they live in, et cetera.\n\nBut here is the thing: the AI only sentences people in a racist way because it has learned that from humans. We're already racist as fuck in our sentencing, AI is not necessarily going to make that worse unless we go about doing this in the most dumb way imaginable (seriously, \"garbage in-garbage out\" is like Machine Learning 101). All we see now is that it currently does have the same biases that we have. But if the training data is properly cleaned and the outputs are not going to be misinterpreted, AI sentencing could actually one day free us from biased and racist judges.",

Let\u2019s say that a company creates an algorithm to help with triage or prioritizing scheduling for life saving procedures. It combs through medical records and health outcomes and takes in current records to determine a priority. Most people will probably say that it is highly unethical to factor a patients race into those decisions. So the decision is made to not include patients race in the medical records. Some hospitals may even say it\u2019s also an attempt to be neutral not let human bias cloud decisions. \n\nBut let\u2019s say the AI starts to accurately group patients by race based on X-rays and other diagnostic tests. It then goes out and finds similar patients in the data set.  In the US, racial minorities often have worse health outcomes because they often lack access to healthcare and systemic racism. The data set would show this. \n\nBecause of this the algorithm would spit out a lower priority for some racial groups because they had worse health outcomes in the data set. They triage or procedure is delayed and the patient has a worse health outcome, which seemingly proves the algorithm\u2019s assessment. \n\nNobody told the AI to be racist. But the dataset and the AIs ability to accurately group races by X-rays made it so past and current inequities are pushed and reinforced. And the worst part is people can just throw up there hands and say that computers are making the decisions an not humans. \n\nAs discussed in the book, Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O\u2019Neil, these bad algorithms can and do reinforce existing inequities along racial and socioeconomic lines. So the fact that the AI can racially group people based on X-rays is problematic. Yes, there are medical conditions where race is a factor, but you don\u2019t need an X-ray to tell you the patients race.",

You in no way intend it to be racist.\n\nHow you make an AI is you get some kind of data and set a \"goal\" for the AI. \n\nSo you go okay, how can I tell if a candidate will be good? Hmm, you look at data from currently existing people in that position who have the job.  What things do they have in common.\n\nWell ok if racism exists in the field then white people are more likely to be promoted, and you know this so you dont include if their race. Theres the classic studfy of where they have two resumes identical of someone named like richard, and someone named Jamal, and richard gets hired more. So you scrub all names from the data. so the ai cant be influenced by that.\n\nBut then often times cities are fairly segregated due to things like redlining, so you have to scrub any kind of data about their zipcode.\n\nOk, so this stuff isnt directly relevant to if an employee is doing well anyways, right? so what would you want to include.\n\nMaybe like employee performance reviews, right? but if the reviewer is biased, the results of the reviews are biased. Same things for like salary, or awards or accolades.\n\nThis is what is meant by structural racism. Its weaved into every aspect of life, its often unnoticable if you are a white person like me and not paying attention to it.\n\n\n-------------------\nSo my question is, you said dont make the ai racist.  What data would you use to insure it would be racist? Because its a lot harder than you might think. \n\nIm not trying to condemn anyone here, im just saying that why it needs to be paid attention to and monitored, and we need to look at laws etc about how ai can be used by law enforcement, companies, governments, hospitals, etc. \n\n You",

Neural networks and other machine learning models are too complex to be evaluated in detail, which means we never really know what they're learning from the training sets we give them.  Imagine you're building an AI system to recognize cars in the lab.  You feed it a million examples, test it a million times to determine it's 80% accurate, then cut it loose in the wild only to discover that in the real world it's only 30% accurate.  You go back, run more tests, and then discover that 80% of the pictures in your training sets are of cars with hood ornaments. You didn't actually build a car detector - you built a hood ornament detector.\n\nThis study, if correct, tells us that even in data where we scrub all the indicators we might use to identify race out of our training set there are still enough for a computer to tell the difference. If the computer can still see race, it can and almost certainly will be incorporated into its internal model and inappropriately skew its analysis of whatever we want it to actually look for.",

After training, our model was able to identify 98% of the labeled cancer patients! What could go wrong? We deploy immediately to help save lives. \n\nFollowup, the model has been correctly identifying cancer in 97% of white patients but has seen substantial failings in minority populations. How is this possible? Our test scores showed that minority x-rays were identified at the same level of accuracy as others. Well, after combing through our data we found that minority x-rays were less likely to be correctly labeled as cancerous. After assessing feature importance we found that our model looks at race as a factor in predicting cancer and has a tendency to return false negatives for minority populations. As a result we have been systematically misdiagnosing minority people as cancer free for the last year. \n\nIf the model can be trained identify race in x-rays, it can learn to ascribe those traits as diagnostic features in other applications where the race of the patient wasn't provided as an input feature. So we need to be extremely persnickety about the datasets we use for training models in patient diagnosis.",

The concept that we call race is partially (but not entirely) determined by genetic factors that ARE biological truths and ARE predictors of all kinds of health outcomes. But treating those genetic factors as the *actual* definition of race (and therefore that categorization based on race, done properly, is identical to genetic categorization) misses out on a lot of very real race-driven outcomes that are a big problem in the health care system and do not have a genetic basis at all.\n\nSo the risk is that, when we're reinforcing these systems, intentionally or otherwise, with our ad hoc ideas about what race is, we end up creating a system that seems to be purely data driven and not have any racial meaning encoded in it explicitly (or even, we might argue, implicitly), and yet the fucked up parts of our racial thinking have somehow infiltrated it. And THAT poses a huge fucking danger of serving to reinforce our unfounded thinking as having a pure empirical basis.\n\nAs a very quick example, it's been shown that medical professionals as a whole in the United States consistently underestimate the amount of pain that black women experience in childbirth (as in, given the exact same behavior and self-reporting of pain from a black mother and a white mother, doctors will statistically evaluate the white woman as being in more pain). Evaluation of this behavior has led us to believe that this is actually a (usually) unconscious psychological bias taking place in the doctor's mind. The science does not suggest that doctors are correctly identifying that the black women are actually in less pain. \n\nBut, if that doctors assessment gets into medical records and then into an AI system (even with race fully anonymized), and that same system also gets a hold of the skeletal x-ray data and process that we know allows it to create meaningful categories that correlate with the same genetic information that also (loosely) correlates with our social conception of race...\n\nWell now you have an AI that theoretically doesn't know what race is and doesn't have any racial biases. And yet the AI is now looking at X-ray data from someone with a lot of Sub-Saharan genetics and predicting that they will need less pain management during childbirth...\n\nEDIT: Before someone reads this and takes issue with the idea that race isn't \"a predictor of literally anything,\" I should probably clarify. Race is a predictor of all kinds of health outcomes that have a social component. If the question is whether someone will be seen as a drug-seeker when they seek help with pain, race is a huge predictor because that outcome depends heavily on the social factors and biases of the people in the system. What I mean is that race itself is not a health predictor in the way that we usually use it in statements like \"black people are at higher risk of sickle cell.\" Being black does not put you at higher risk. Certain genetic factors put you at higher risk and some of those same genetic factors increase the likelihood that you will be identified (by society or by yourself) as black. But there isn't a direct causal connection between blackness and sickle cell, they are two independent things that share an indirect connection further back in the causal chain.",

Same thing for Africans as runners, the professional runners usually come out of a culture of hunters and live in high altitudes allowing them to have increase oxygen intake for running long distance. That is patently ridiculous to think race plays any role in any of that.",

Also many island nations exist around the world in warmer more hospitible places than europe. Though what he mentioned they say it's due to differing centers of gravity in part due to slightly differing bellybuttons. The bellybutton while its not a defining factor but rather a slight natural push in regards to certain sports that while negated for the most part with training is still a factor. They say say the center of gravity is slightly different in races hence why race is brought into it.\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2010/07/are-bellybuttons-the-key-to-playing-sports/340518/",

This means it's not simply the high altitude training and hunting culture that predispose most folks from those regions to be excellent distance runners, though culture and climate are also powerful factors. Race isn't the other powerful factor we're after here, genetics is. Certain genes favor certain bodytypes for one activity over another. The same folks doing the distance running are less good at climbing mountains with a load, like many of my shorter, barrel-chested friends from Central and South America. The tendency for areas to produce athletes that excel for a particular sport is high when the genetic similarity of the region in question is high. Which sport depends on which genes + what culture + what environment.\n\nA fascinating, perhaps less loaded way to look at the dynamics in question is variations in nose style. The different shapes lead to ease of breathing in different environments. Tall, thin noses have a chance to warm the dry, cold air, much like short wide ones can do the opposite better in hot, humid places.",

It means more asian kids will get into the school they applied to, right? But it will also end up feeding into the 'model minority' stereotypes - The school faculty and staff might be inclined to view an asian student who isn't doing well in their classes as someone who is 'clearly capable of more' and 'just being lazy', even if the real problem is that they're dealing with an unchecked learning disability or mental health issue that's impairing their performance. The school might be less willing to reach out with resources to assist, preferring to spend those resources on the students who 'really need them' instead, and suddenly the 'positive' racial bias is looking a lot like racism.",

That's because the sickle cell gene is primarily found in people living in [specific areas of Africa,](https://miro.medium.com/0*VKS36ceCtyoFiJ-a.png) as in its geographic, not racial.   Last I checked, the leading theory was that it tracks the distribution of malaria because the gene gives people protection from malaria.\n\nThe reason it is true in the US is because of slavery.  The majority of enslaved people were stolen from areas with high rates of the sickle cell gene like West Africa rather than places with low rates of the gene like South and East Africa.",

What matters is the result.   Conservatives have turned \"racist\" into an synonym for \"asshole\" so they can do racist things and then say \"Racists are bad people.  I am a good person, therefore nothing I do is racist.\"\n\nWhich is how we end up with people like segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace, who was so racist that Eisenhower literally had to send in the national guard to enforce the desegregation ruling from SCOTUS, saying things like:\n\n* *\"I think the biggest racists in the world are those who call other folks racist.\"*   (source: [youtube 35sec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7_LG5aB0xs))",

There is no negative result from saying that African Americans have higher rates of sickle cell anemia than other racial groups. Even if it isn't 100% of the details, it's still more or less correct and not discriminatory.\n\nMild, benevolent, and accidental racism is definitely a thing though. Many stereotypes fall under one or more of these categories. Like the stereotype that Asians are all good at math. That's typically not insulting, and is often meant as a compliment, but can still have a negative result by reducing someone's accomplishments to a racial stereotype, or putting unfair expectations on people who are not good at math.\n\nI just don't see a real negative side to pointing out that black Americans are more likely to get this specific disease.

For an AI everything is just data there is no difference at all. However in reality AIs are sort of like small children.  \nIf you teach them the wrong thing they are going to replicate it without any selfreflection.  \n\n\nIf an AI is able to detect the race it suddenly changes the dataset for its analysis. And these datasets are not unbiased. In a world where we humans created totally neutral datasets nothing of that would be an issue but we do not have such datasets. Diseases occuring more often in one group than in the other are a good example for this. If such a disease occurs often for one group we probably have a lot of data on it for said group with a realistic chance of representation.  \nHowever for another group te data can be totally off just because we usually do not test them for this disease. They have it in a much higher number than anticipated we just do not know of it since we do not test people outside of a group that is more vulnerable to it.  \n\n\nGenerally whenever an AI is able to detect elements that are subject to human biases it is very cocnerning because they just make things worse. At that moment these biases become a self fulfilling prophecy which is horrible for a tool that is meant to be helpful.",

Race has been systematically defined as something other than what is commonly referred to as someone's \"race\". In fact skin color is genetically determined.

Not all white people have freckles or red hair and lots of people from other races have freckles, I happen to have married an Indian woman who has tons of them.",

That's the issue. An AI is only as good as the data that you are feeding it. If the dataset you train it on is a bunch of disease diagnoses, and doctors are less likely to correctly identify the disease for black people (due to complex socioeconomics, such as black people on average being poorer and thus can afford less second opinions etc), then the AI will learn that it should misdiagnose black people.\n\nWhich yknow, is a problem. It's a known problem that plagues loads of AI research. Datasets are biased so the AI learns to be biased as well.",

Race itself doesn\u2019t have any play on health. It\u2019s just used as a catch-all for other things that do. \n\nOftentimes, it seems that a certain disease is more prevalent among a certain race, but that\u2019s actually more likely attributed to residential/work conditions or socioeconomic status. For example, a Black person who has a solidly upper-middle class family history and works a desk job will have a super different health profile than a Black person who has a family history of generational poverty, low access to nutritional food, and works a factory job. They\u2019re both \u201cblack\u201d but in this case, that means absolutely nothing.\n\nThe other issue with race in medicine is that it\u2019s literally a socially constructed and self identified category. Besides the fact that you cannot determine someone\u2019s race from their genome, we\u2019d call an African American whose family has been in America for centuries \u201cBlack \u201d We\u2019d also call someone who currently lives in Africa \u201cBlack.\u201d The diseases that are popularly considered to occur more in specific races (like sickle cell) will have greatly different prevalence in both of these populations. Race as a category is still flawed. \n\nOf course, we still use it in medicine, because race is sometimes a mediocre proxy for a lot of factors, but there\u2019s a case to be made for its use and it\u2019s disuse. \n\ntl;dr: race itself as a medical category tells us little to nothing. Racial bias in ai is not at all helpful for clinical practice and is more likely to be problematic.",

I literally do not care. Present the argument why race cannot be used as a category. I do not value the fact that it comes from biologists. Arguments from authority are irrelevant to me. Arguments or nothing. The fact is that races obviously differ genetically, or 23andme and similar companies could not tell you your genetic ancestry. We can tell someone's race by their DNA with essentially perfect accuracy. This is because there are genetic differences between races.\n\n> It is widely recognised in scholarship that race - a 19th/20th century concept - does not hold up to scientific scrutiny\n\nYou can keep repeating it as much as you like, but unless you can provide an actually good reason, you will not convince me. [Here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19695787) is a paper going over actual reasons why race is a valid category. And [here](https://the-boomer-tribune.medium.com/hbd-jump-starter-7473063d4f6d) is a good reader if you don't want to read an actual paper.\n\n> this remains the general consensus\n\nThere is no such consensus, and given that this very link makes the same bad arguments you hear everywhere (more variation within than between, continuum fallacy, etc), nobody should care one bit about what they say.\n\nThere are basically only a few arguments ever made against the existence of race, so let's go over how they are all crap:\n\n1. Human variation isn't gradual.\n\nThis is just the continuum fallacy. When does red become purple become blue? Obviously the colours are still useful categories.\n\n2. There is more variation within groups than between.\n\nThis is Lewontin's fallacy. First, there are many species with recognized sub-species with less differentiation than in humans. Second, it is largely irrelevant to the question of whether population group differences are biologically meaningful. The original claim is even based on analyses at single genetic loci. When we use hundreds, which we should, we can match DNA to self-reported race with almost perfect accuracy.\n\n3. Racial classifications are arbitrary.\n\nThis applies to colours as well. How much blue can we add to red before we start calling it purple instead? This simply doesn't matter. Is the category useful? Does it have predictive validity?",

It's family/genetic history, visits to geographic locations, etc...\n\nWhen you hear about stuff like \"African Americans are more prone to heart attacks,\" that's pretty much always due to a multitude of things like the average diet and living condition of African Americans, not just because African Americans are more prone to heart attacks as a race.\n\nThere is some research that suggests some genetic variations have allowed certain groups to be afflicted with a particular condition or disease more often, or resist a particular condition/disease better (malaria and sickle cell anemia being a key example of both), but it's again mostly because of genetic variance rather the differences between actual species, which tend to be far more stark.",

The FDA has very loose regulations here, and there is a lot of bias - race, age, sex, and other patient characteristics but also modality (scanner) specific settings IE voltage, backplate type, slice thickness, etc. \n\nThere is no easy way for an AI vendor to prove that they have developed software that runs accurately for all possible biases. There's no regulations that say your AI must have been tested on a diverse population. In some cases (mostly mammography) there are strong controls related to devices, IE your AI must be validated for each make/model of modality you are going to be using the AI with. \n\nPrior to this study, there was no evidence that you race was visible in radiology imaging. Therefor, there was no evidence that datasets for AI training needed to be racially diverse. Thus no AI vendors reported statistics related to race and whether their AI worked for all races.\n\nYou do see in research publications reported diversity statistics (specifically - race/age/sex and sometimes other features like BMI). It is not common to see performance by bias in many publications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo answer the other half of your question, the software that radiologists use to review images (PACS) does not include race. They could get this from the EMR. Radiologists often do not use race in their diagnostics unless it is specifically noted in the order that they are looking for a race specific disease. There aren't very many that are visible on medical imaging.",

It's not impossible to mitigate or even utilize these things but it can also be concerning if not treated carefully.\n\nMachine learning amplifies an existing bias. That is, features from underrepresented groups can be ignored or misclassified. If a model can detect race, it can use it as a feature. But if that feature has low representation, your model might be less accurate. You can definitely model them better with better sampling to make sure your data is diverse.\n\nI believe the point is *we didn't know* that x-rays can be predictors for race, so perhaps not all the samples were properly stratified to ensure a model that works with everyone. Now that the computer figured it out and can introduce \"race\" as a feature. We probably should go back and check out our samples to see if we have enough data. We probably should check this with other publications too.\n\nThen we need to think about what other features other than race do play a role and became hidden features of the model. Do we have a good samples from other groups for each of these things? What's the impact of this bias? Does it mean that a newer and fancier ML works worse for minorities than an existing methodology? Do we recommend blacks to do an older test? Is that ethical? Or perhaps it actually increases detection for everyone but not to the same level of accuracy. How about now?\n\n\nNone of this new. But when your algorithm starts predicting things you thought would be random, your assumption is now invalid. You might need to go back and check your methodology and resample or update your methodology.",

So, basically what the person said above is true, but it goes further (which is something other anthro people are skipping in these comments) as you need to consider not just geographical area but time. Different areas may have a rich histories of migration with replacement, absorbtion, and intermingling of cultures from other regions through out the past. Thus those places can have more variance due to past admixtures of populations. This is in part why in human osteology (besdors forensic, where a broader estimate is still of use) there was a move away from identifying the 'race' of individuals alongside a moriad of other reasons. It can be used, but in a very broad geographical sense and even then you need to account for variation as you can get some random trends. For example I'm on a site now where we finished off a cemetery and all the males had 'female' looking skulls (though pelvises rang true), which was a noted trend for that time period in that very specific region. Further influences on the morphology also include diet, health (hormonal imbalances, for example), and even activity.",

                            "body": "All people have the same basic skeletons, but the proportions can vary in different people around the globe. For example the width of your nose compared to the size of your skull, or the size/shape of your teeth, or how broad your tibia are compared to their width, that sort of thing. So from this, we can take an educated guess where someone (or their ancestors) might be from based on the proportions of their skeletons. Since the geographical origins of your ancestors broadly correlate with race, it's therefore possible to estimate race based on someone's bone structure. \n\n\nThats the thory, but reality is a lot more messy. While it is true that on average, a person from region A will have certain differences compared to a person from region B, that does not necessarily mean that a specific individual from region A will be different from a specific individual from region B. For example, on average, the corners of the jaw are sharper in Asian people than in Europeans. But if I were to measure my co-workers, Jiayan might actually have a more rounded jaw then Helga, because Jiayan has a rounder jaw than the average for China, and Helga has a sharper one than average for Germany. So whenever we guess where someone is from based on skeletal features, it's more of a probability than an exact pinpoint. You could guess the Helga is more likely to be European than African or South American, but you couldn't say \"this one's certainly from Germany\". On top of that, you also have to consider that someone may have ancestors from very different places. Maybe the reason Jiayan has a rounder jaw than most Chinese people is because her grandfather was from India. You can see how it's very easy for this technique to label mixed-race people as whatever race best fits their proportions, even though it might not fit how they would identify themselves. The fact that race doesn't always fit geographical origins makes this even harder. \n\nTldr: yes, the proportions of certain bones in the body do vary with geographic origin and can therefore be used to guess someone's race naesd on their skeleton, but its not an exact science and has important limitations.",

If you do know one forensic anthropologist, I suppose it's reasonable you'd know multiple, especially if that \"forensic anthropologist\" is not actually employed full-time as one, but is just used as a part-time special consultant (many professors are part-time consultants for criminal investigations). Note that this is very different from the more common forensics specialist who is not actually a trained biological anthropologist.",

Uterine cancer happens to non-intersex AFAB people but not to non-intersex AMAB people.\n\nWhen you have a limited supply of time and money to allot to medical treatment, targeted awareness campaigns etc, it helps to have heuristics, even if they might be wrong sometimes, as long as they're right often enough to outweigh the problems caused when they're wrong. Screening AFAB people for uterine cancer is useful. Screening AMAB people for it isn't.\n\nIncreasing awareness about sickle cell anaemia is more useful for hospital staff working in London which has a large population of black people, not so much in Dunny on the Wold: population 1 white farmer and a dachshund named Colin.\n\nEdit: \\* just realised that you and I are using slightly different definitions of race and ethnicity. I'm talking about race in the sense of broad, fuzzy-edged categories identifiable through skeletal traits.

It sounds like they're unsure about what exactly the neural net is picking up on in the data that's letting it be this precise, so I think we're a ways off from seeing it actually implemented in any way.\n\nAs to the bias, I'd imagine as long as it is made clear what it was picking up on it shouldn't matter whether you're Atlanta black or SA black, as long as it's understood that the machine is picking up on, say, \"West African ancestry\" and that indicates higher risk of sickle cell.",

This is because a lot of diseases have historically been described by the symptoms suffered specifically by white men and there hasn't been the sort of wide-scale scientific revision necessary to reconcile this for most diseases (which itself is made difficult because historical malpractice has created distrust in the medical industry in several minority communities).  It's made more difficult because many doctors play pretend at scientist without the requisite training or understanding and they \"experiment\" on patients without consent or even the baseline documentation required for whatever they learn to be useful to the scientific community.  A disturbing trend is that aggregate medical outcomes tend to improve during medical science conferences, when the \"scientist\"-doctors are distracted and away from their offices...\n\nBasically, Western medicine is a long way from genuinely being as scientific as it claims to be.  Fortunately, the desire to integrate science and data-driven approaches exposes existing flaws and limitations, but the industry is very resistant to change so it's a question which of these flaws and limitations will be addressed and how well we will address them.  Machine learning is going to keep exposing them until we either fix the issues or quit using machine learning.",

You obviously have no reason to trust me or her, but I'm fairly sure she said the paper was related to heart attacks so it was probably that paper or a similar one.  I wouldn't be surprised if it extended outside cardiology, but other fields get less attention and there was supposedly a significant amount of backlash to this study.",

These human operators have implicit biases that affect what they train the AI to consider. Overwhelmingly, certain racial minorities are overlooked as a result of these biases.\n\nFor example, if I train an AI that uses a data set that consists almost entirely of the \"average\" person, that average person will be an able-bodied white male of about 200 pounds and stand 5 foot 10 inches, which is actually a very particular kind of person and hardly representative of anything but itself. But the AI might only be trained to consider this type of person, as it's an acceptable \"normal standard.\" Black people and especially Native Americans are frequently not considered to be representative, so they would be excluded as special cases, which biases the AI against them.\n\nAnother example that might be useful is to consider things like medical dummies for learning how to resuscitate or use the Heimlich maneuver. The average dummy is male proportioned, so people don't actually get trained on female bodies, the same as an AI doesn't get trained on certain things and so performs worse at them.\n\nSo yes, the AI doesn't like black people. There's nothing racist about it. It just requires a little bit of tweaking to account for these biases, which researchers already attempt to do to the best of their ability. Some things are insidious and tend to escape notice, however.",

What race are European Jews?\n\nThere are differences between groups of humans. Where peoples\u2019 notions are being gutted is that biological races don\u2019t map very well onto what people think races are. Categories like \u201cwhite\u201d and \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cHispanics\u201d are completely man-made and have nothing to do with biology. \n\nAlmost all human diversity is contained within Africa (there\u2019s basically five groups of humans and all are African groups, with one existing out of Africa as well). Italy has five distinct groups within it, while from Vienna to Moscow there\u2019s basically no differences. England has surprisingly sharp genetic differences in its various regions, but zero definitions of race reflect this. East Asians have the most Neanderthal DNA, but all humans have some (even Africans thanks to back-migration). Hispanic is obviously a made up word since ancient definition required that brown Americans be classified as white, but racists were uncomfortable with that. European Jews are largely Italian and Slavic, with only some middle eastern heritage. \n\nRace is fake, differences in populations is very real. You can often spot the racist by looking for people insisting that race is real without any understanding of the specifics. Fuck those guys, because facts don\u2019t care about their feelings.",

                                    "body": "Not really... This is called \"morphology\" and \"anthropometric measurement\".  Here's the [wiki on morphology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphology_(biology)). And here is the [wiki for anthropometric measurement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry). Both are totally valid practices in biological sciences. As examples, here is a [quick paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16077306/) on the topic, and [here's another](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30726000/).\n\nTLDR: Morphology is the use of appearance and measurements to categorize organisms.\n\nIn this case, specifically, /u/MaybeTheDoctor refers to the subset of morphology that is called \"craniology\". [Craniology is different from phrenology](https://sciencing.com/the-difference-between-craniology-phrenology-12759816.html).\n\nTLDR: Morphology is a *scientific* practice of categorizing organisms through measurable traits, based on well designed statistical analyses. Craniology is the application of this method to any vertebrate organism's skull's properties. Phrenology is the *non scientific* practice that attempts to use skull measurements and anomalies to draw conclusions specifically about human beings' personal traits. \n\nSaying one group has skulls with a certain trait and another group has skulls with another trait can be valid, depending on the statistical evidence backing this claim. Saying one is intelligent and another is not based on the presence or absence of a random bump is not valid.\n\nWith that said, craniology has generally fallen out of favor among most western anthropologists over the last half century, because of its understandably uncomfortable closeness to phrenology and the difficulty in deriving any scientifically useful findings from it. However, due to cultural and academic isolation from the west, anthropologists from ex-Soviet nations still carry out studies on this topic. Try searching on google scholar if interested - if you look at the \"cited by\" links for these studies, you'll find that they're not particularly disputed, but they're also not cited much at all, which goes to show that they're not really pushing science forward very much either.\n\nWith that also said... Morphology and craniology are widely employed in paleoanthropology, as these are pretty much the only tools available for identifying and categorizing early homonid remains (see figure 2 in this [link](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/overview-of-hominin-evolution-89010983/)). These methods are also use pretty extensively within medical sciences, where morphology can be used to assist in the diagnosis of illnesses.",

It has little to do with science.  \nYou say 'sickle cell anemia is more prevalent in the black community.'  \nBut that is only generally true... in certain situations. And even then, it's generally true in the United States and parts of Africa. And in the United States that's because a majority (I think, but don't know) of Black Americans have genetic ancestry tracing back to those parts of Africa with the highest prevalence of the gene that indicates sickle cell.  \n[Here's a map of sickle cell in Africa](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3708126/figure/fig1/?report=objectonly).  \nAre Africans in South Africa or Somalia not 'Black?' But you see the low prevalence of sickle cell in those areas? That's when your statement becomes problematic.  \n  \nWhen we say things like 'sickle cell anemia is more prevalent in the black community,' it can misrepresent reality. And the medical community recognizes this. They are actively working on ways to remove race from studies and treatment. People are being mis- and underdiagnosed because race is an imperfect and unscientific category. And it often relies on self-reporting (which carries a whole slew of problems).",

There is no 'natural law' analogue for 'race' in science. Determining race is subjective, imprecise, and our genes are so much more informative to healthcare providers than the unreliable category that is 'race.'  \n  \nAt no point have I said that there's no such thing as race. Again, it's a social construct. It exists. Or that there is no reason for anyone to keep track of people's race.

And apparently, neither do the researchers themselves.\n\nBut that doesn't mean a thing to the near-real-time sea change that is happening in the medical community regarding finding ways to remove 'race' from diagnosis and treatment.  \nThe article itself doesn't hint at making a claim that race isn't a social construct.   \n\nConsider this passages from OP's link (all bold is my emphasis):  \n>Artificial intelligence scans of X-ray pictures were more likely **to miss** indicators of sickness among Black persons, according to earlier research. Scientists must first figure out why this is happening.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is designed to replicate human thinking in order to discover patterns in data fast. However, this means **it is susceptible to the same biases unintentionally**. Worse, **their intricacy makes it difficult to divorce our prejudices from them.**\n\n>Scientists are now unsure why the AI system is so good at identifying race from photographs that don't appear to contain such information. Even with minimal information, such as omitting hints about bone density or focusing on a tiny portion of the body, the models were very good at predicting the race represented in the file.\n**It's likely that the system is detecting melanin,** the pigment that gives skin its color, in ways that science has yet to discover.\n\n>\"Our finding that AI can accurately predict self-reported race, even from corrupted, cropped, and noised medical images, often when clinical experts cannot, creates **an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging,**\" write the researchers.  \n  \n  \nI'd also point out this (from the Lancet paper itself, what OP's link was reporting on):  \n  \n>There were several limitations to this work. Most importantly, we relied on self-reported race as the ground truth for our predictions. There has been extensive research into the association between self-reported race and genetic ancestry, which has shown that there is more genetic variation within races than between races, and that race is more a social construct than a biological construct.24 We note that in the context of racial discrimination and bias, the vector of harm is not genetic ancestry but the social and cultural construct that of racial identity, which we have defined as the combination of external perceptions and self-identification of race. Indeed, biased decisions are not informed by genetic ancestry information, which is not directly available to medical decision makers in almost any plausible scenario. As such, self-reported race should be considered a strong proxy for racial identity.   \n \n>Our study was also limited by the availability of racial identity labels and the small cohorts of patients from many racial identity categories. As such, we focused on Asian, Black, and White patients, and excluded patient populations that were too small to adequately analyse (eg, Native American patients). Additionally, Hispanic patient populations were also excluded because of variations in how this population was recorded across datasets. Moreover, our experiments to exclude bone density involved brightness clipping at 60% and evaluating average body tissue pixels, with no methods to evaluate if there was residual bone tissue that remained on the images. Future work could look at isolating different signals before image reconstruction.  \n  \n\n>We finally note that this work did not establish new disparities in AI model performance by race. Our study was instead informed by previously published literature that has shown disparities in some of the tasks we investigated.10,  39 **The combination of reported disparities and the findings of this study suggest that the strong capacity of models to recognise race in medical images could lead to patient harm. In other words, AI models can not only predict the patients' race from their medical images, but appear to make use of this capability to produce different health outcomes for members of different racial groups.**    \n  \nAI can apparently recognize race from xrays. What to do with that information? Is it even helpful?   \n  \nThe researchers themselves caution that this ability could further cement disparate health outcomes based on race. Again, 'race' is a social construct. There is just as much (if not more) genetic diversity found among what we call 'races' than between them. Making medical decisions based on race is an inherently risky practice. And we know this better today than ever before.",

The only way you can say that this is true if you ignore something as simple as cumulative probability. For each gene, there is a slight difference in its frequency across populations. If you use very few SNPs, you could arrive at this conclusion, but if you actually use a lot (like you would do if you weren't trying to deliberately hide race), then we can match DNA to self-identified ace with over 99% accuracy.",

Further, common diseases with differences in prevalence among ethnic groups can have both genetic and environmental risk factors.\"  \n  \nThis is saying neither 'race' nor 'ethnicity (non-scientific terms... they just aren't) are as specific as 'genetic ancestry' (a measurable and definable element).  \nIt's also saying that common diseases (notice they didn't say rare ones), where we see disproportionate outcomes based on race (like kidney disease) can have both genetic and environmental risk factors. How valid then, is race, from a clinical standpoint if there are risk factors that don't arise from 'race' or even genetics?  \n  \nBut this one is perhaps my favorite:  \n>Genetically inferred clusters often, but not always, correlate with commonly used \u201cracial\u201d classifications based on broad geographic origin, although many individuals (especially those who are admixed) do not neatly cluster into a group. Individuals who are admixed may have different ancestry at specific regions of the genome (referred to as \u201clocal ancestry\u201d) despite similar global ancestries. For example, African Americans, on average, have approximately 80% West African ancestry and approximately 20% European ancestry (though this varies among individuals and by geographic region in the United States) but they may have 100% European, 100% African, or mixed ancestry at particular loci that affect disease (4, 14). Thus, \u201cglobal genetic\u201d ancestries may not correspond with genetic risk for disease at any particular locus. A risk allele in an individual who self identifies as \u201cAfrican American\u201d and with high percentage of African ancestry can derive from a European ancestor, while a risk allele inherited from an African ancestor may occur in an African American individual with mostly European ancestry. Genetic ancestry and underlying patterns of genetic diversity can only affect disparity of disease through the portion of the genome that differs among populations and that associates with disease. Hence, \u201cracial\u201d classifications may not capture genetic differences that associate with disease risk. Variants associating with diseases will not, in most cases, have any relationship to \u201crace\u201d as socially defined, and hence, using this categorization can be misleading.  \n  \nSo, for example, if race is included in current eGFR calculations ([as it currently is](https://www.kidney.org/atoz/content/race-and-egfr-what-controversy)), and eGFR calculations are used to diagnose someone's kidney function and to help make decisions on whether or not someone goes on dialysis or is a candidate for kidney transplantation... why would we leave such impactful decisions to 'race.' Or in this case, how a patient self-identifies their race?  \n  \n>Race was originally included in eGFR calculations because clinical trials demonstrated that people who **self-identify** as Black/African American can have, on average, higher levels of creatinine in their blood. It was thought the reason why was due to differences in muscle mass, diet, and the way the kidneys eliminate creatinine.\n  \nThis means that whether or not someone self-identifies as Black has their results 'adjusted' because of their race. The question facing people before an eGFR test (even if people are asked before an eGFR... it's part of many annual blood screens - you may not even have answered the question because of the eGFR, they may take it from a questionnaire you answered the first time you entered the doc's office) is whether or not they're 'Black' (or white or Hispanic, etc.). But that has potentially little to no relevance on the calculation to determine how well your kidneys function. And if it has potentially little to no relevance to the calculation, how relevant is it to your diagnosis or treatment? Who's to say a specific Black patient patient has the genetically-relevant indicators for worse kidney disease than patients who aren't Black? You may be comfortable taking that chance. But there's a whole community that isn't comfortable with such shortcuts.\n  \nWhy are you fighting the science here? The provable science? The settled science?

So we know that you can train an AI system to replicate and exacerbate racial biases.\n\nHealthcare already has a [problem](https://www.statnews.com/2022/02/23/landmark-report-systemic-racism-medicine-so-little-has-changed/) with not identifying or treating diseases in minority populations.\n\nSo if the AI is determining race, what might it do with that information? Real doctors seem to use it to discount diagnoses that should be obvious. Is that bias present in the training data? Is the AI seeing a bunch of data that are training it to say \"caucasian + cancer = flag, black + cancer = clean?\" \n\nThere are plenty of diseases that present differently depending on race, sex, etc, but if you don't know how or why your AI is able to detect a patients race based off the training data you provided, that is not helpful.",

With current technology, we can\u2019t tell the AI to look for CF. We can only tell it to look at an X-ray, and decide whether it looks more like one of the example X-rays from a diagnosed CF patient vs. one of the example X-rays from a patient that is NOT diagnosed with CF. Therefore, given that the original samples are biased, if the AI is doing a good job of following what it\u2019s told (= basing its results on similarity to the original samples), then it is supposed to be biased as well!\n\nLike all computers, AI is designed and optimized to do exactly precisely what we tell it to do, not what we really *want* it to do\u2026 in fact, AI isn\u2019t even capable yet of understanding what we really want it to do. We\u2019re not really sure yet how to design AI that understands what we\u2019re \u201creally\u201d asking, only how to make it give us very \u201cliteral\u201d/technically correct responses.

A known problem currently is that doctors tend to allow their own biases to override diagnostic criteria and thus misdiagnose people.\n\nA good example of this is the problem obese people have. Yes, being obese is unhealthy. But it\u2019s possible to have multiple types of medical problems simultaneously, and a lot of obese people will go to the doctor with a problem and be told to lose weight even though there\u2019s a really obvious acute diagnosis that isn\u2019t obesity. The canonical example is an obese 55 year old male with a complaint like \u201cmy left arm hurts and my indigestion has gotten really bad\u201d being sent away with advice to lose weight, when pain in the left arm and discomfort in the chest area is a known indicator of a heart attack. Yes, long term losing weight will remove stress on the heart, but first maybe run some tests to see if your patient is having a heart attack that will kill them before they can get around to that?",

So from a purely medical perspective one would be interested in understanding the susceptibility of illnesses and conditions of these different homogeneous ethnicities but the AI defines them as \"black\" based on an unknown variable, likely melanin. If the inputted categories would include all the world\u2019s different ethnicities, which is hard to do in this modern global era where homogeneous ethnicities has diversified its genetics, then perhaps it could be more useful in medics.",

I do wonder how they label \"race\" in their training data. If they follow a national classifier, then I guess you'd need to look into that classifier as a possible source of human bias. But if we *assume* that the classifier is very simplistic and only takes into account the very basic classification of races, then the problem would really move towards having enough varied data. And the bias would be reduced as the data increases (even if the model doesn't change).\n\nI suppose there's more attributes they are training on than just x-rays and race labels, so they gotta figure out if any of them could be easily tampered with.",

The concern is that the data is a measurement of our imperfect world, and the AI will be learning about what is 'normal' from that data.  Let's put it in more concrete terms for an example:\n\nBlack communities are often at serious financial disadvantage.  That often correlates with malnutrition.  Thus, you would expect a higher proportion of malnourished people from black communities.  A human doctor should have the understanding that that is a side effect of generalized poverty in an area, but an AI may or may not have that context, and may or may not learn the connection properly.  It may instead learn that Black people are just naturally less healthy (the numbers for 'healthy' are different for that race), and thus might recommend lesser treatment in ways that are hard to detect without bulk analysis of huge amounts of treatments.  We can't interrogate the AI to understand why it came to that conclusion like we could a human.\n\nNow, that might seem like a data bias with an obvious fix, and maybe it is, but that's just for example purposes to make it obvious.  There are tons of biases like that that are much, much hard to spot, even human doctors often become blind to them.  But humans can re-consider and re-evaluate their choices.  If we come to rely on an AI trained thusly, we won't have that kind of reasoning to inspect and re-consider.\n\nWorse still, there's no reason to believe that there won't be people at a later date who will benefit from such systemic malpractice, just as there are today.  Changing that would compound the already difficult battle to improve care for disadvantaged people with the veil of AI black-box learning making it even harder to prove that they're being shortchanged.\n\nThat is what people mean when they say bias will become 'baked in' - flawed, unaccountable AI learning that won't be able to distinguish what is normal today (with all the faults of the world as-is) from what *should be* normal.",

Thing is, we don\u2019t actually have data on crimes happening. We have data on people being arrested, charged, and/or convicted. So if police in a certain city tend to arrest black people who smoke pot/shoplift/do other minor crimes but tend to let white people who commit the same crimes off the hook with a warning, then the data reflects higher arrests of black people. Which we interpret as them being more likely to commit the crime, even if they aren\u2019t. Then because of that AI, even more police are sent to that neighbourhood to jail people for minor offences that they would let someone else off the hook for.\n\nAlgorithms like this can also be used for hiring/firing, denying or granting parole, etc. Really important things that impact people\u2019s lives. If black people are more likely to get fired over minor things in some schools, the algorithm may make it harder for them to get hired somewhere else because of the firing record.

This risk is compounded by the fact that human experts cannot similarly identify racial identity from medical images, meaning that human oversight of AI models is of limited use to recognise and mitigate this problem. This issue creates an enormous risk for all model deployments in medical imaging: if an AI model relies on its ability to detect racial identity to make medical decisions, but in doing so produced race-specific errors, clinical radiologists (who do not typically have access to racial demographic information) would not be able to tell, thereby possibly leading to errors in health-care decision processes.\n\nThere is absolutely no such thing as fixing bugs in neural networks.

Get the saw. I don't care if he's here for a teeth cleaning. It's AI. We have to do what it says!\"\n\nThe AI will give it's recommendations for years while the doctors are accepting or rejecting the system output and that stage is a part of the training process. Real world doctors will be judging the system's capabilities and comparing/contrasting what the AI suggests with what the doctor actually did. When the AI exceeds the capabilities of the doctors, then it'll be trusted more and more as a primary diagnosis, but that's not going to happen in early stages. \n\nWe have safeguards to protect us from doctors and nurses acting in a way that's not beneficial to the patient. Review boards, accreditation, board certifications, medical records, FDA, clinical trials... The medical field has more regulations that probably any other field. Nobody is going to just give the software hospital control with no safeguards. \n\nI strongly disagree that AI is employed without safeguards in other sectors. The whole ML industry is still getting up to speed. None of the systems are given blind trust. That would be like a coach showing a kid how to hit the ball and then walking away without doing any follow through. That is not how AI training works. You look over all the failures and what makes a failure happen, and then modify the training to cover the situations. That said, if the software is batting 100% on certain diagnoses, then the software will get used for that segment, but that doesn't mean it will be used for every other disorder or disease that has lower success rates.",

More often than not people of color experience a much lower efficacy when seeking treatment from a medical professional.

When there is already bias in a system, an AI built on the knowledge/bias of the past could continue these traditions without active human involvement. \n\nThis is a red flag not a red alert, sometimes/maybe even often, an AI can see thing humans cannot and we wouldn't be doing our due diligence if we don't keep a tight leash on a technology which has the potential to replace flesh and blood doctors within the foreseeable future.",

Pro-White, anti-Black physician bias was associated with White patients feeling more respected by the physician\u201d\n\nHowever none of these studies actually score the said provider, it\u2019s just the perception from the individual. \n\nSo they attempt to join that to a study reviewing associative implicit bias from individuals, and specifically look at healthcare individuals. The ask color/verbiage and add points. Health care apparently rank in low to moderate. That study has no zero. Just low, moderate, high. \n\nI think a better question/analysis in that regard would be which fields specifically scored predominantly high, or low for that matter.\n\nI know citing studies to cite studies is fun, but this is a grain of salt type review honestly.",

If racial genetics is the source of bias, then bias diagnosis isn't a bad thing. If the bias is from medical records tending to fail a demographic, then that needs to be weighted out, but that's why you look for such biases in the system early on, so you can reinforce the good results and downweigh the bad results. \n\nIt's why we try to make sure children are taught by trained teachers, not just left to decide on their own what to learn while growing up. You teach them while looking at how the data is being received and modify your lessons if bad patterns emerge.",

Bottom line is \"race\" is not a meaningful construct because there is no way to draw clean lines; there are cultures within and across color, creed, religion and local history. It's not actually as simple as color or color combinations. \n\nMultiple generations of migration patterns, interbreeding, diasporas and changing national/political lines due to war complicate things on issues that are difficult for anyone to understand and which even those affected parties disagree on. How far do you go back to draw the lines and how do you decide that for any one race or everybody at the same time? \n\nSo this is highly intriguing because if AI has identified \"races,\" it would be very interesting to know what they are and what they mean from at least a medical perspective. We can probably get rid of religion and nationality even if those affect breeding at some level, but how can we tell who is who without the computers? How do we give the computers what level of information?",

I'd like to know where the AI was consistently messing up, if there was consistency spotted. Because they can't tell with their eyeballs. \n\nWhat the AI did, which is especially concerning, is it looked for correlations across the data set by race, which was given to it, *until it found them.* The researchers note that it is even true in poor and different kinds of images. On its face this sounds astounding, but this is what we expect from AI: *make* patterns. \n\nThe reason this is concerning is that we can find false correlations between all kinds of things, one famous, simple example being ice cream sales and crime rates. It's a type i error in statistics, aka false positive. It's the most common/easiest mistake to think you've found a link between two events when there isn't one and in our personal lives we have to be vigilant that we aren't \"telling stories\" about events as we try to make sense out of them or else we will react suboptimally and maybe even blame someone unfairly. \n\nIt's on the researchers to design AI and then correct for its mistakes: they have to figure out how in the world AI grouped 90% of images together just like someone figured out that people want more ice cream when it's warm outside and people go out more and longer when it's warm outside so are more likely to commit crimes. Even if the phenomenon aren't *linked*, they are certainly happening at the same time. This means that if I told you ice cream sales are higher than average, it would be a good guess that crime is, too, but as a doctor in this case you could be very wrong to say, tell someone they ought to pay for a few genetically-relevant tests because AI says their heritage is something they don't look like.",

That is a useless divide (and American-centric because it's a \"hey this is how we divide races in the USA) because the percentages vary by countries and even within regions of countries. 55% of people from Greece are lactose intolerance but only 4% from Denmark are. 13% are people from Niger are lactose intolerant but virtually everyone from Ghana is. 93% from Iraq are but only 28% from Saudi Arabia.\n\n[https://milk.procon.org/lactose-intolerance-by-country/#:\\~:text=Lactose%20Intolerance%20by%20Country%20%20%20%20Country,%20%2098%25%20%2085%20more%20rows%20](https://milk.procon.org/lactose-intolerance-by-country/#:~:text=Lactose%20Intolerance%20by%20Country%20%20%20%20Country,%20%2098%25%20%2085%20more%20rows%20)\n\nThe problem with the concept of \"race\" is that the divisions that each country concocts are not based off of biological factors. They are always based off of social factors and phenotypical factors. Biological factors exist in humans and different villages and ethnicities, but there aren't any large sets of biological factors that correlate with the American classifications of race.\n\nCertainly if you compare African Americans and Caucasoid American bone structure, you're going to find general patterns among them... but that's just because most White Americans are Western European and most Black Americans are Coastal-West African. What if you compared Kho-San people with Greek people with Dinka people with Irish people?\n\nAnd that's why \"race\" is still a useless factor in medical science. Being \"White\" or \"Black\" is meaningless and tells you nothing. What tells you something is if you have Dinka roots or Greek roots or Mixtecan roots or Haida roots. These biological differences are specific to very small population groups, not these mega-clusters that are \"racial\".",

So currently a lot of AI usage is diagnosis based, treatment from an AI is a whole different level of complexity.\n\nThe million test case question unfortunately comes back around to bias; how can we be sure that there isn't bias in the training and testing data? Are we seeing different outcomes for different demographics within the success rates?

Say its prescribing drugs for osteoporosis or something - it learns from historical data that black people get the cheap drug and white people get the better one - because on average in the training set black people were less wealthy and had worse health insurance.  It's learned something real about the training data, but then letting it suggest drugs it wouldn't necessarily make the best decisions for patients based on their medical needs, even if it is accurately predicting what a doctor would typically do.\n\nIt's true that populations have different needs, especially with sex, but teasing that apart from medical sexism or just random coincidences in the training set will be hard and will need a lot of deliberate care.",

This is because speed is the product of stride length x stride rate. To compensate for reduced stride length, one must increase their stride rate, thereby exerting more of a metabolic cost. By no coincidence, this is one of the primary stressors for why hominins have grown in stature over time from being roughly chimpanzee sized to their current modern stature (achieved by *H. erectus* a million years ago, so it obviously plateaued out in terms of metabolic benefits). i.e. Humans have evolved for running.\n\nIn long distance marathons, this is incredibly important, but biological adaptations are always secondary to cultural ones. Eliud Kipchoge could just be really well conditioned and have a good strategy as a result of life long training, which allows him to overcome his potential biological limitations as a result of being short.\n\nBut maybe there's some metabolic cost associated with being really tall, such that there's basically a goldilocks zone. I'm not sure. A larger person does have a higher basal metabolic rate. The genetic potential for humans hasn't really changed over time since we achieved our current stature, and that was over a million years ago, so maybe that's part of it, but that would also suggest that human \"race\" really is irrelevant in determining genetic potential since the differences are really quite minor compared to individual variation. It's not like all Africans are 6 foot tall and all Asians are 5 foot.",

Conventional geographic \"racial\" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes.\"[13] While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color,[14] the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups \u2013 meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a \"pure\" ancestry as obsolete.[11] Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery. **As a result, scholars have begun to broaden discourses of race by defining it as a social construct and exploring the historical contexts that led to its inception and persistence in contemporary society.[15]**\n\n>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_society#Race_as_a_social_construct_and_populationism",

Even the advocates of the ecotype race concept acknowledge that the same adaptation can arise independently in different parts of the species\u2019 range (Pigliucci & Kaplan, 2003). Hence, ecotypes do not in general correspond to evolutionary lineages, and specifically human ecotypes cannot correspond to evolutionary lineages in humans since the hypothesis of multiple evolutionary lineages within the human species is rejected, as noted earlier. Moreover, variation in environmental factors can induce natural selection that results in local adaptations even in species that are not genetically subdivided at all (Templeton, 2006); that is, the ecotypes are only genetically differentiated at the gene loci under selection and show little to no genetic differentiation over the remainder of the genome. In these cases, the geographic distributions of the local adaptations reflect the geography of environmental factors and not boundaries of overall genetic differentiation. Hence, the ecotype concept in general does not correspond to populations demarcated by sharp boundaries of genetic differentiation that exceed some threshold. This is also certainly the case in humans because there are no human populations with sharp genetic boundaries that exceed the thresholds used in the non-human literature.\n\n>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3737365/",

They simply report at the same rates, but blacks consistently lie about their drug use more than whites.\n\nI did a quick Google and some [2018 numbers](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2784528#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20in%202018%20the,be%20arrested%20for%20cannabis%20possession.) (the first that came up and I figure good enough for this) peg the Black usage rate at 45.3% and White at 53.6%. I also found a study [comparing self reports of usage to drug test results.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3455900/) That study showed concordance (as in self report and test results matched) on marijuana was 100% for whites and 87% for blacks. I feel I should note the sample sizes were pretty small 109 and 191 respectively but that's the study I could find.\n\nEven taken at face value that would mean only 13% of black respondants who said they didn't smoke are lying compared to no white respondants. So of the 54.7% of blacks that report no marijuana use assuming 13% are lying we need to add 7.11% to their total. That gets us to blacks at 52.41% and whites still at 53.6%. So even under your premise, the numbers are still basically identical, and I feel I should note, actually higher for whites even if only marginally. Even if blacks do lie more, it's not enough to actually move the comparison a significant amount. So actually yes, it is clearly true that usage rates do not vary across ethnicities to any meaningful degree.\n\nAnd I looked up the exact arrest rate difference. It's 3.73 times higher for blacks.\n\n>We also know that blacks are more likely to buy drugs outside, buy from strangers, etc. Basically, they engage in riskier behaviour.\n\nWhat's your basis for that? I couldn't find anything on that with a quick Google. It better be pretty significant because it needs to account for a 373% disparity in possession arrests.",

My next question though would be how much should we assume those \"risk\" differences should affect arrest rates? I honestly have no idea. Maybe based on those numbers they should be 10x higher. Or maybe they should only be 10% higher. I'd be curious to see some data on how relevant these risk factors are.

You used lifetime usage, which is probably the worst data you could use if you actually cared about drug use relevant to arrest rates. It could mean that 45.3% of blacks just try marijuana once in their life, but 53.6% of whites are constantly high on it, the opposite, or anywhere in between.\n\n> What sort of data would you need to see to entertain the idea that racial bias may exist?\n\nWell, I'd expect more than just pretty much looking at numbers of arrests. Controlling for fairly obvious variables like the ones I mentioned should be a minimum. Ideally, you'd want one analysis that combined all of that into one model and then looked at the odds of arrest, right?\n\n> If it can be explained by other variables that's fine but absent that why is inferring the bias invalid?\n\nBecause there is a good chance it can be explained through other variables, plus the lack of any measurable racial bias in the general population, plus the lack of difference in arrest rates between white and black cops, etc.",

Cars, in the common way you define them, do not have artificial intelligence and thus do not have large implications of de-humanizing at such a grand scale.

In fact, you want to use the car analogy - cars have years of laws that try to coral negative events.  AI does not have a government enforced laws that ensure we keep a careful on something that can be extremely bad for our society as a whole.  Theres really no \"too far\" enforced, and we've already seen evidence where AI is utilized to prioritize profit for a high percent, versus the good of humanity.\n\nIt'd be like having cars on the road with no legal recourse for misusing your privilege to drive.  \n\n(\"That doesn't stop everyone\" isn't an argument, just in case we were going down that path.

We've been doing both enforced and self segregation among our various races for centuries. It's not terribly surprising that we've managed to self sort some genetic conditions into out artificially selected \"races\" as a result.\n\nFor example sickle cell anemia is bad, but it also helps prevent malaria (both diseases deal with red blood cells). As a result it evolved to be more common in high malaria areas because evolutionarily, not dying of malaria is more beneficial than the downsides of the genetic disorder that probably won't kill you before child bearing age at least. Transplant a bunch of people from, oh say Sub-Saharan Africa to North America, and then socially and legally make it unacceptable for them to mix with people outside of their group for a few hundred years and you end up with African Americans as a group being much more likely to have that particular disorder.\n\nNow here's the thing to understand, it isn't \"being black\" that makes them likely to have sickle cell. The melanin content of their skin isn't a risk factor. But for the reasons I just explained a person of African decent is statistically more likely to suffer from that particular genetic condition due to long term social reasons. If we start mixing black and white ans brown and whatever color people freely eventually the disease would become equally prevalent along all the \"races\".\n\nIn the meantime though, it's probably wise for doctors to keep in mind that for certain patients be more on the lookout for certain symptoms. We don't want to screw up getting someone proper care trying to be \"color blind\" or whatever.",

Doctors ignore symptoms, misdiagnose with a lack of care, and a study done showed that a large portion of medical students surveyed still perceived a difference in level of pain felt and that these persons have higher pain tolerances.

This means that it could take the X-ray of a person of one race and it could mistakenly encode some hidden assumption that the person's bone structure is similar to that of some other race in the image's representation. \n\nThe performance of the model is then tied to distribution of X-ray image data for different races and this *could* hamper performance if it's used in conjunction with other systems that rely on race information. It becomes harder to trust the model's output for an X-ray image of a race it's not trained on.",

If the AI can detect race from X-rays, that means that race-based correlations and biases present in diagnostic data can affect an AI diagnosis. Humans are unable to identify race from X-rays, thus the researchers had assumed that a diagnosis based solely on X-rays would be free of a racial bias. They found some evidence suggesting that this wasn't the case, and attempted to identify race via X-ray. The sole reason this study was conducted was that they found evidence of racial bias at the level of AI diagnosis. So yes, it is concerning that the AI can detect race from X-rays.

If it was the same model then maybe the training data was itself heavily bias because of humans creating the training data. If the model was different than the diagnosis model and the training data was ONLY using the fact about race and nothing else then I am not sure how it would be possible to say AI is racially bias?

Someone linked the original article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589750022000632\n\nThe reason of this research exist is other researches where a negative bias is found:\n\n>For example, Seyyed-Kalantari and colleagues showed that AI models produce significant differences in the accuracy of automated chest x-ray diagnosis across racial and other demographic groups, even when the models only had access to the chest x-ray itself. Importantly, if used, such models would lead to more patients who are Black and female being incorrectly identified as healthy compared with patients who are White and male.\n\nAI being able to predict the race from x-ray isn't the problem in itself, they say so themselves: \n\n>In our study, we emphasise that the ability of AI to predict racial identity is itself not the issue of importance...\n\nBut since this doesnt exist in a vacuum and there are legitimate concerns about fault and bias of current AI models, this can be a problem. They say: \n\n>This risk is compounded by the fact that human experts cannot similarly identify racial identity from medical images, meaning that human oversight of AI models is of limited use to recognise and mitigate this problem.\n\n>if an AI model relies on its ability to detect racial identity to make medical decisions, but in doing so produced race-specific errors, clinical radiologists (...) would not be able to tell, thereby possibly leading to errors in health-care decision processes.",

One more question though: if the racial bias exists whether the diagnosis comes from a human or an AI, wouldn't that problem still exist no matter what? Or in other words, the diagnosis is not any more biased than what a human could have done, right? So the concern here is that using AI didn't solve the problem of the existing racial bias, rather than there being a problem of some new racial bias being created solely due to AI being involved.",

Because humans makes mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes are rooted in culture for example. But then your solution to this is just the same bias presented in a new way. \n\nBut then, while it is not discussed here, AI can create new problems. Amazon abandoned a recruitment AI project where they tried to create the ultimate tool that would objectively select the best candidates. Then it discriminated against women, and afaik they didnt even specify gender in CVs. AI decided that some resumes have the word \"women\" in it, dunno like attending student clubs with \"women\" in title. Not only that, it deemed anyone graduated from a all women college unqualified.\n\nOn another note, I find the racial bias discussion around self driving cars interesting. It also shows that how important the training data is. \n\nLong story short: companies train their AI with limited data where it causes darker skinned people to not getting recognized which causes crashes. Then there are companies generating CG humans to train self driving AIs, but they also have limited data of darker skinned people to generate CG humans so that isnt perfect either. On top of that, 3D tech basically focussed on rendering light skin tones and getting darker skin right is a lot harder. So when you generate CG Humans, black people dont look as realistic as white people which causes further problems because you trained your AI on not-so-accurate looking CG Humans to recognize real humans.",

First, population is a broader term than race. It can refer to people who are being groups by any number of characteristics (age, religion, geography, language etc). When it comes to genetic variation, geography and ancestry are far and away the more accurate categories with which to analyze a population than race. For example, take a black person and a white person who are lumped into the category of \"black\" and \"white\" solely due to skin tone, hair texture, etc (which is how all racial groups get sorted: visually). Say they both had a grandparent from India. They are going to have more in common genetically with each other than they are with another person of the same race who has a grandparent from Australia or Brazil and none from India. Look up haplogroup maps ( which tracks alleles or different gene variants) and how they vary across continents. Geography and ancestry/genetic heritage is what is relevant, not what racial category the person is perceived as or sorted into. In conclusion, white people do not have more in common genetically with other white people. They have more in common genetically with members of any race who come from the same geographical population. There are genetic difference sbetween different GEOGRAPHIC populations, NOT different RACIAL populations.",

If by \"race\" you mean black, white, Asian, etc. then of course those are not precise, neatly divided groups because they are way too general and don't take into account mixed race people and the variations within those categories. But all of those minor details don't change the fact that different populations that evolved separately in different environments for thousands of years are indeed genetically different and can often be identified by physical features. If I see two black people and two Asian people, I can safely assume that the Asian people are more genetically similar to each other than they are to the black people.",

There are genetic difference sbetween different GEOGRAPHIC populations, NOT different RACIAL populations.\n\nMost people whom we would define visually as part of the same \"race\" had ancestors who developed in close proximity geographically, so this seems like a moot point.\n\nYes, if a city for example is 99% \"white\", and I had a black ancestor who lived in that city their entire life, I'm going to have all in common with that ancestor and nothing in common with anyone they lived around in that location. This seems like dumb mental gymnastics, because we're talking about averages from hundreds and hundreds of generations. Before modern transportation, people did not often travel across the globe and mate with a completely different gene pool. It was this way for a long time, and that created the \"races\" we see today.",

People who you would identify visually as a part of the same race come from huge geographical diversity. Africa is fucking huge and is the cradle of civilization, thus huge genetic variety. There is more genetic variation between 2 black African people in different countries in Africa than there is between a black and white person living in the U.S. Look it up. Watch the documentary I posted (Race: The Power of an Illusion) They literally do a genetic test with students who assume they are going to be more similar genetically to others students of the same race and they aren't at all.

There are far more genetic similarities between populations of whites and blacks living in the US now, mainly because the US is not a very old country and its built upon the immigration of tons of different gene pools getting together and mating in that short period of time. Tribes in Africa can stay secluded for many generations without mixing with other tribes on the other side of the continent. This seems pretty obvious, and would clearly explain the theoretical difference of genetic makeup in this hypothetical scenario that you're pointing out. \n\nThing is, you're still going after pie in the sky fringe scenarios, when the important thing is generalizations here. It's important to note that because we're dealing with generalizations, we cannot extrapolate this data and place someone into a box simply because of their skin color or hair type. It's obviously more complex than that.\n\nFrom the way you're commenting, this appears to be very personal for you. I'd advise stepping back and leaving the emotions out of it, I'm just trying to have a fact based discourse.",

You just said two black people from secluded African tribes will of course show more genetic variation between each other than a white and black person from the U.S. That is exactly what the fuck I said, and is exactly the point. Genetic similarity comes from geography and ancestry, not race. Just wow.",

Alleles are the different \u201cflavors\u201d of a gene. For instance, all humans have the same genes that code for hair: the different alleles are why hair comes in all types of colors and textures.\n\nIn the Stanford study, over 92% of alleles were found in two or more regions, and almost half of the alleles studied were present in all seven major geographical regions. The observation that the vast majority of the alleles were shared over multiple regions, or even throughout the entire world, points to the fundamental similarity of all people around the world\u2014an idea that has been supported by many other studies (Figure 1B).\n\nIf separate racial or ethnic groups actually existed, we would expect to find \u201ctrademark\u201d alleles and other genetic features that are characteristic of a single group but not present in any others. However, the 2002 Stanford study found that only 7.4% of over 4000 alleles were specific to one geographical region. Furthermore, even when region-specific alleles did appear, they only occurred in about 1% of the people from that region\u2014hardly enough to be any kind of trademark. Thus, there is no evidence that the groups we commonly call \u201craces\u201d have distinct, unifying genetic identities. In fact, there is ample variation within races (Figure 1B).\n\nUltimately, there is so much ambiguity between the races, and so much variation within them, that two people of European descent may be more genetically similar to an Asian person than they are to each other\"\nhttps://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/science-genetics-reshaping-race-debate-21st-century/\n\n\nFrom a genetics standpoint there is as much difference between two people considered to be the same race as there is between individuals of separate races.

If all the picutre are otherwise identical, it might indeed be detecting only ancestry-influenced features. But it is still possible the AI is detecting race, independent of biology. Imagine this scenario, one set of pictures are coming from under-resourced hospitals with low-quality xrays that predominantly serves one racial group, and another set is coming from a higher resourced hospital with better quality pictures, the AI can indeed be detecting that difference in quality of xrays in this case  which is highly correlated with race, and still has absolutely nothing to do with biology.",

The tree of life is regularly re-organized and organisms are moved to entirely new branches at every level, does that mean the entire taxonomy of life is not biological? None of it is rigorously defined by clear genetic borders.

Noone will argue ancestry is NOT biological. It is by definition. and you point that out in your argument as well.\n\nJust a take step back, and really try to separate from ancestry from race. they are 2 really completely different concept that we colloquially often use as synonyms. The only way they are actually related is that race is loosely based on ancestry.\n\nOnce you do that separation, and focus on race by itself. It's easy to see its purely social construct just as nationality is a purely political construct.\n\nNationality, like race, is also loosely based on ancestry. But you are able to clearly see that it is a political construct whose definition depends on politics of the day. Race is exactly the same thing, it is a social construct whose definition depends on the society and era (what is called white race in US is different from is called white race in England. What is called black race in america is different from what is black race in Brazil or Nigeria. Heck what is considered white race in America in 1950 is different from what is considered white race in 2020). But the biologies and ancestries of humans haven't changed, yet what people consider what race is what's changing and continues. Race is whatever the society of the time chooses it to mean. That's why say race is a purely social construct that honestly exists to primarily do a social job.\n\nRace is indeed loosely based on ancestry and that's often why people think they are the same. But they are not. For example, in the US, you are of black race in US likely suggests you have some African ancestry among your recent ancestors. To what extent who knows.  Heck someone considered white race in US might have more recent african ancestry than you. Also what the heck does it even mean to be white in America? Is it having full european ancestry (few white will qualify), or partial european ancestry(many considered blacks will qualify) or ancestry doesn't even matter and it's just if you look white. That's among the reasons why we say \"race\" as a concept is loosely based on \"ancestry\", because it kinda is but when you dig into it really totally isn't. A persons race at a point in time, is whatever the society of that time says it is.\n\nBut end of day, race =/= ancestry.  Ancestry is biology. Race is not. Race is social that can serve as a useful but flawed proxy when we need to discuss biology, because race is loosely based on ancestry.\n\nEdit: when I say ancestry, I mean recent ancestry. Because if you go back in far far in time enough, we are all africans. And if you go back even further than that we are all primates etc",

Arguing that ancestry is biology but race isn't simply showing that you don't understand how biological taxonomy works.\n\nNationality has nothing to do with ancestry. If I move to Mexico and get citizenship I am a Mexican national, even if I was born in Ireland of Bavarian heritage. There is absolutely no ancestry there. Meanwhile, race is inherent in your biological tissues identifiable even on x-ray. You cannot change it. It is biology.\n\nBeing black having to do with African ancestry is only the result of attempted political correctness by trying to ignore race, the same thing you are attempting to do.  This is a problem. African Americans can be white. Black people can't be white.\n\nRace does not have to be perfectly defined for it to exist. Being white means whoever looks white and is generally identified as white. An x-ray being able to identify this proves that there is more to it than just skin color. If race was a social construct this would not be possible. A person isn't whatever race society says they are, they are whatever race they look like.

That is such an incomplete, overly simplified abstraction to the point of being completely useless. It tends to perpetuate nonsense such as linear branching (i.e. one branch leading to next set of branches). Modern biology has nothing, like nothing at all to do with observable phenotypes. Its about genetics. And the story is not a branching tree. It's a complicated web with routing back to itself, contorting on itself, with dead ends, false restarts and everything in between. The viewpoint you are mentioning is like someone that studied biology decades ago, and have dated and limited understanding of how things are. There's a reason there's no taxonomy class in any modern biology. Trying to classify living things in a simple coherent tree is a futile and worthless exercises, much more so if you are trying to do that based on observable phenotypes.",

Being white means whoever looks white and is generally identified as white. An x-ray being able to identify this proves that there is more to it than just skin color. If race was a social construct this would not be possible. A person isn't whatever race society says they are, they are whatever race they look like. Nobody ever said black people are white because it was socially desirable or not.\n\nand i thought you were debating in good faith. so we can detect \"who generally looks white from xrays\" \n\nwe can similarly detect who generally is Mexican from xrays. yet you agree nationality is a totally political construct. It's not nationality we are detecting, its' the fact that people from the nation defined as Mexico today tend to share ancestral features that can be detected on xray. Its ancestry we are detecting not nationality even though we can infer nationatility from that.\n\nRace works similarly, but you won't get it.",

That's what the articles say. That's what the study shows. I'm not adding a single thing to it.\n\nNationality is nothing like race.

It is not bone density or height either. Race is a set of characteristics we can recognize as race.

This is simply how we organize living things in biology, and very little is based on genetics, which if you learn about you will see how little they apply to taxonomy and race.\n\nI do not hold any belief as to the significance of these markers, that is an entirely different topic.

When scientists say that there is no race in biology, what they mean is that they haven't identified any gene clusters which make race relevant to biology.

That distinction is of huge import. Without separating ancestry from race, you leave wide room for racists, and racial supremacy theorists to wrongly and falsely ground their silly biases in biology. those biases almost always reflect a social difference rather than some difference based in ancestral features or genetics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Race is first and foremost a biological phenomenon.\n\nThis is just patently false.

Biological race far predates the social constructs around it.\n\nonly someone who is completely ignorant about history will make a statement like the part in bold. We did invent race. and we continue to re-invent race. We didn't invent differences in how different humans look. duh But we definitely invented language and structure to group them i.e. race, and the purpose was always to serve a social function, not a biological function. Social function such as who is in-group, who is out group. who has power in a society, who doesn't. whose culture is considered norm, which isn't, etc. We looked at humans, and grouped them for a social purpose and loosely  and inconsistently used perceptible difference in humans to justify that social construct.  Its definition often has lots of social biases and baggages built into it. Biases and baggages that don't have any biology to them. Not only did we invent race, we continue to re-invent it to suit whatever social needs du jour is.  That's why it has no consistent definition from place to place or from era to era. It is first and foremost a social construct that serves primary a social job-to-be-done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Again, you can argue that race as a social construct is more meaningful than biologic, but that is an entirely different point.

There's just no way to make race rigorously jive with biology. race is at best loosely defined by ancestry. 2 different concepts",

It is nothing like alchemy vs chemistry because current taxonomy has not changed to some formal definition codified by genetic delineation. You seem to be under the impression that there is some 'hard' version of modern biology that has inarguable, calculable, genetic foundation to categorizing living things. No such thing exists, it's all vaguely defined by what things look like. Just like race. Race is just as valid as any of it. Race is biology.

The tree of life is called a tree because it has a single root and branches. Your continued attempt to differentiate ancestry from race is pointless. A bird has a common ancestor to a human, it is a bird only because at some point the common ancestors diverged into different races which then become species, which then become genii and so on down the tree. Species are splits in ancestry. Race is a split in ancestry. Race is ancestry, they are both biology.\n\nWe can't see nationality on x-rays because the subject of one x-ray can have multiple nationalities in their life time.

Race as a concept has a social origin and serves a social need. Yeah  we use it as a proxy for heritable traits (or what I call ancestry). It's somewhat useful, but still a very imperfect proxy (what you call shorthand). It's not just about granualrity. But I feel very strongly, that it is absolutely necessary to call out that race is a purely social construct, with no biological basis. Not doing so, allows racists or and racial supremacy theorists to  try to pretend  all their silly racial biases has basis in biology when it just doesn't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If you say, 'this dude's white', only socially relevant information is communicated.

The definition and origins are all based on the social purpose it serves. That's why it lacks consistency  of definition across time and across space. The only thing that has ever been consistent about race is that it primarily serves a social function: who is in the accepted in-group and who isn't, and how do we choose to identify  and delineate those groups.\n\nYes race is often used as a proxy for ancestry (i.e what areas of the world did you recent ancestors used to call home). in some places e.g. medicine (or even this article), it has some limited usefulness. But that doesn't change the fact that race is not and can not be defined by biology. Race as a biological concept is just entirely meaningless.",

The amount of melanin in Obama's skin doesn't diminish the amount of European genes he inherited from his mother. \n\nAs for why Obama is considered black it is because by law throughout most of the U.S. until the 90's one could only be a single race on a birth certificate. Not just that but bi-racial children with a white parent were automatically listed as the race of the non-white parent. It wouldn't have mattered if Obama had light skin. By law he was born black.",

This is a good first step in finding an explanation, as it verifies that indeed race can be part of an AI model, even if it's one that only looks at X Rays of parts of the body assumed to have no racial information. Finding an explanation would increase our trust in other models that we assume work without racial data. The explanation could also lead us to better understanding other bugs/quirks of the system.\n\nIn this whole comment section, I'm struck that people don't seem to be taking this as open-endedly as I think they should. There shouldn't be, like, an aim or a super specific goal here. There's just unanswered questions, and a desire to learn/improve.",

Philosophically, that's completely true. Drawing a definite line between colors, particularly because they exist on a continuous spectrum, feels arbitrary. But science tells us that the wavelength of visible light varies and we perceive those as different colors. We can assign \"arbitrary\" categorizations to visible light and derive meaning from that, and oftentimes it's very beneficial. There's a reason why people stop at traffic lights billions of times a day without any confusion, despite the claimed arbitrariness.\n\nThis is literally no different than saying someone is African American, clearly denoting that they have African ancestral heritage, and are part of a grouping that differs from Europeans. This is nothing pernicious, harmful, or incorrect in using African American as the name of a racial category, which is based on 100% real and occasionally meaningful distinctions based on ancestry.",

Later, two more got added- Americanoid and Australoid, because differences between native populations of Americas and Mongoloid people were so big it was impossible to classify them as one race. Same with native people of Australia, they are way too different from African people.\n\nSo, you can sort of squint your eyes and draw lines there. It will be so crude and inaccurate (because person from Iceland and person from Pakistan would be same people, as well as indigenous person from Russian north and Chinese south) but you sort of can do that somewhat. Okay.\n\nHere where it falls apart. Africa is the most diverse continent on the planet, genetically. Irish person and Japanese person are world apart but have more in common than person from Namibia and Ethiopia. People from North-East Africa are very genetically close to European people, while people from West Africa are way more isolated and unique. But we chose to call them Africanoid. Why? People from Australia are black, and color of their skin is the only thing that makes them similar to African people because they\u2019ve been hanging out in Australia all by themselves for 70,000 years. \n\nConcept of races is not racist, it\u2019s just stupid and inaccurate. If you walk on foot from France to China, you won\u2019t notice the transition of people because it\u2019s a slow and long spectrum.\n\nEverything that America does with races is completely ridiculous and can get [so idiotic](https://imgur.com/a/Gw7kAYX) that you will bleed from facepalming that hard.",

The AIs task was to identify someone's race based on their skeleton. It completes the task successfully. If anything, that is the proof that the AI was trained well.\n\nOr do you somehow think that if the AI was less successful at its task that it would mean it is less biased?",

Interracial relationships are a thing for a long time, so it's not that easy.\n\nAnyway I guess I just don't like the article, because it claims some massive AI bias, but there isn't a word about what the bias is. You cannot create a model that predicts something reliably and then say it is biased because everything is inherently biased. I mean you can, but what was even the point of creating that model? You might as well just say AI is biased and not bother with the model, because the model they created doesn't prove their theory in any way. To me this just smells like some biased researchers who went into this with the goal of claiming AI is racist and when they found no proof they claimed it anyway... Might just be the author of the article though.",

All these \"AI\" things you hear about in the news and internet are just glorified heavy duty calculators that use specific equations to output patterns from a huge dataset (that you have to input yourself), they're good for example to find the fastest road from one city to another, it does that by trying out all the paths very very quickly and finds what was the shortest. Or in this case skimmed through X-ray pictures (the glorified calculator was given (by a person) very many images and with each image given what race it belongs to) and the \"AI\" just went through all of them very fast and have out info if some things were in a pattern. They just go through numbers (pixels can also just be numbers) much more quickly than a human does that's why they're useful. AI (artificial intelligence) is just a buzzword and I hate that it is being used everywhere, there is not a whiff of intelligence to them, Machine Learning algorithms would be more correct term but even that is a reach. To learn something would require the ability to think imo. Softwares are not even close to \"thinking\" and there is a real possibility that we will never invent a true AI because we don't understand even our own brain's consciousness workings well enough to invent one. So the fear of emerging Skynet is MAYBE a topic in 20-30+ years but definitely not now.",

Different races are generally going to have different average bone structures in much the same way that they'll have different average heights/skin tones/hair or eye color. The AI noticed structural patterns that were common across individuals from the same race and eventually was able to predict the race based on the patterns it was seeing.   \n   \nSo the *how* is fairly straightforward. That said, I can absolutely understand how this is something we need to control for when having AI give a diagnosis.   \n   \nHonestly my concern here is less with the AI and more with the methods that scientists are using to train it. Unintentional bias being introduced into the system can lead to a lot of headache.",

Since the people who are let off with a warning aren\u2019t recorded as committing the crime, the computer displays this as black people committing the crime more, because all it has is the arrest records.\n\nThe data from the neighbourhood, along with data from many others, is fed into an algorithm. Algorithms can be used for really important things, like whether someone gets parole. The AI decides a certain person is more likely to shoplift because it was fed data that said that. Now black people whose cases are seen by that AI are less likely to get parole/rated as a higher risk for recidivism. \n\nThis tech allows race to be taken into account by AIs. That could be used to look for and eliminate biased, but if it\u2019s used carelessly it could also take human racism and apply it to decisions even more than it does now.",

People usually don\u2019t know that they\u2019re being judged by an algorithm. So some are denied parole because of past charges they personally have (whether or not those charges were justified) and some are denied because of the bias in the algorithm, and they\u2019ll never know.\n\nI\u2019m happy to give more info about algorithms, but not in the mood to get into an argument about whether or not racism exists in the legal system. If you want to pretend an officer spending 9 minutes murdering someone on film and having a ton of supporters who don\u2019t want him charged for it is normal and has nothing to do with race, that\u2019s on you.",

And then instead of using that as more reason to regulate police, continue acting like there isn\u2019t a problem. \n\nHigher rates of shitty treatment in some communities doesn\u2019t mean anyone is claiming shitty treatment doesn\u2019t happen in other communities.

Arrest rates line up with victimisation data. We take surveys of people who have been victims of crime and ask about multiple things, one of which is the criminal's race. Arrest rates line up with this data, suggesting little to no racial bias in arrest rates. In fact, if I remember right, there is actually a slight bias in favour of blacks for these minor crimes.",

I know these are stereotypes, though there is some connection.\n\nThere is nothing intrinsically bad about AI being able to deduce someone\u2019s probable race from an X-ray.\n\nTheir medical history probably includes this info anyway.\n\nAnd because, while we are all human, there are some race-related medical conditions, sickle-cell being a common one.\n\nI would actually be more concerned if the AI was not able to spot these patterns - it would reduce my trust in its accuracy if it could not.\n\nThis is a non-story really.\n\nI know I can identify several different races just by looking at someone\u2019s face (corresponding to some degree to their bone structure) - Surely an accurate AI should have some ability to do that too.",

                                                    "body": "So I assume that your assessment of research on orbits came from a paper like this: https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/121/1/121_120803/_pdf/-char/en\n\nLet\u2019s take some quotes to show how much you don\u2019t understand \n\n\u201cThree samples, which comprise of skeletons from China, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Europe, were selected to represent modern populations from three major geographical areas, i.e. Asia, Africa, and Europe. However, we acknowledge that these small samples do not encompass the full potential variability of these regions. They are rather representations from each region to test whether standardized geometric morphometrics can be used to distinguish broad geographic specific characteristics.\nThe Asian sample consisted of 40 skeletons, with equal representation from both north and south China, which were sourced from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology. The African sample consisted of 39 skel- etons collected from nine different Bantu-speaking tribes in South Africa. The European sample comprised of 40 skele- tons housed in South Africa.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, your orbital shape nonsense only works for a specific region of Africa. \n\n\u201cUsing geometric morphometrics, the African and Asian specimens share the same distribution area along RW2, and the African and European samples along RW1. This sug- gests that the African sample has a shorter inferior contour, while Asians tend to be taller and symmetrical, with Europe- ans being more inclined and asymmetrical. Additionally, the Asian and European samples could be fundamentally dis- criminated from each other, and both of them overlapped over a large area with the African specimens\u201d essentially meaning that an African orbital shape is more likely to confused with an Asian or African one. But this makes sense as it seems they used a small, un-diverse sample of Southern Africans while they had a diverse sample of White South Africans from the U.K. and Netherlands and other countries and a diverse sample of Chinese people.\n\n\u201cBased on the CVA of the shape variables for the superior contour of the orbit, 24 Asian specimens were correctly dis- criminated, with 6 being assigned to the European group, and 10 to the African group (Table 2). The European sample had the same number of specimens correctly differentiated, while 12.5% clustered with the Asian and 27.5% with the African samples. However, only 41% of the African sample was correctly discerned, with 25.6% clustering with the Asian and 33.3% with the European samples. Overall, the superior contour of the orbit accurately discriminated the re- gional origins for 53.8% of the studied sample.\u201d  This orbital nonsense is literally 50/50 when it comes to identifying someone\u2019s \u201crace\u201d.\n\nAnd it was 41/100 accurate for those Southern Africans showing the skeletal diversity of Africa, so it\u2019s not accurate. Your point isn\u2019t even true. However, my point about the low genetic and skeletal diversity of non-Black Africans is true because it showed that it was 60/100 accurate for both European and Asian samples. \n\nSorry to say, bro, you\u2019re essentially inbred \n\nSo essentially, your orbital nonsense doesn\u2019t work on saying it\u2019s a specific race and can even be mistaken easily for another \u201crace\u201d and it\u2019s not even accurate. Once again showing the skeletal diversity of Africans and you\u2019re talking out of your ass.\n\nIn fact, I guarantee you, that all the research you\u2019ve done into all that nonsense, you\u2019ll see either of two things (or even both!) you\u2019ll see a low, un-diverse sample of Africans from one small regions, or low accuracy when it comes to identifying Africans using these features and perhaps even much higher accuracy for non-Black Africans",

Different sexes can react differently to different amounts of dosage (on average of course) and the same thing goes with even smaller differences like racial differences in bone structure, average height, average bone density, intolerances and so on and so forth.\n\nThese things do not differ because of the american definition of \"race\" but because of the genetic data we get from our ancestors, which is correlated but not equal to our race. (Example a person with 9/10th of its ancestors being from scotland and 1/10th being from the phillipines might still be lactose intolerant, despite being called \"white\" in the USA and therefore LESS likely, but not unkown to be lactose intolerant).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for the convoluted answer.\n\nAt the end of the day, we are just biological machines with a huge amount of data that can be interpreted.",

We're all humans and we're all African if you go back far enough.  Specifically 80,000 years according to all the genetic marker tracing we've found that has really confirmed the [Out of Africa Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recent_African_origin_of_modern_humans).  For ~100,000 years the relative isolation between pockets of humanity has lead to genetic drift and allowed locals to adapt to their environment. The most obvious being how much vitamin D they need from the [average sunlight](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/44y90h/annual_sunshine_hours_map_of_the_world_2753_1400/) of an area. As humanity spread around the globe they picked up mutations and passed them on and we can very clearly see how these things have spread around.   You can pick literally section of the [tree of life](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life_(biology\\)) and group all the descendents together. This doesn't magically stop at humanity. (Although sexual recombination does blend branches together. Mixed races are more than possible and often healthier. Remember, inbreed for ~~freaks~~ interesting features, outbreed for health).  \n\n>Also,what is the race of the increasing number of people of mixed origins? \n\nBoth. Technically it's not an even 50/50 split as you get a random shuffle of genes from mom and dad. But it probably averages out to something pretty close.  You're a mix of everything up in that tree. For [some](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Spain), it should have been mixed a little more. [Much more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pug).\n\n>Or people who live in in historical crossroads?\n\nEverywhere is a crossroads to somewhere. There's really no group of people living at a dead-end. And everyone is closer related to their ancestral neighbors that to groups from the other side of the world. \n\nBut come on. Why push an agenda like this? What's the benefit and for who?  Do people from Japan look different from people from Sudan, on average? Yeah? We know why.     Now, just because we've been able to identify what these concepts out of antiquity really are, it doesn't mean everything the ancients thought about lightning, alchemy, or race is 100% correct.    While \"Asian\" typically doesn't include people from Moscow or Bombay or Mecca (despite being in Asia), the term \"black\" as a stand-in for \"African\" really misses the mark. In the USA \"Black\" is synonymous with south-west African. But they could be more distantly related to a S.African than to someone from China.\n\nIsn't being race-blind supposed to be a bad thing?",

There's no way 8% are producing a 3% birth rate of full condition. \n\nI started this discussion by specifically stating even within races there is great genetic diversity. I'm hoping AI can map it all.\n\nEdit: no need,  the carrier rate in Sub-Saharan Africa is 45%. So compared to Greece's 8% carrier rate I have my answer.

Not just African Americans which I think you shot back with (there's one other poster I'm having this discussion with that I could be mixing up)  but black people in general and that is unequivocally true. \n\nI literally started this discussion by describing how even members of the same race can even have remarkably different features if their people group has been in a strikingly different environment. In this case, the map you showed exactly overlaps with malaria burden maps.\n\nSo a medical professional seeing a black patient walk in with sickle cell symptoms should be more likely to look for that condition first before they would a white person, even in Africa. \n\nEdit: Ah, yes.  You were the one who tried to say I was just talking about African Americans. \n\n>You\u2019re still talking about the African-American community as if they represent all Black people\n\nYou somehow decided that just because countries in the south of Africa have less malaria cases that I was taking about African Americans only. See how silly that is now you see that Africans in general have the highest risk? \n\nWhat would be incredible is if there are enough differences for AI to know the person is from south Africa vs Nigeria and split that up.",

I'm talking aggregates over here and you're responding with anecdotes (at your third goalpost). I'm hoping AI can get to a point where it can go as deeply as anecdotes because right now medicine is all aggregate (for initial diagnosis determination) . Then the most time is spent when that initial one is wrong on figuring out the outlier.

But you're not seeing the forest for the trees. You showing me countries where it isn't a problem doesn't negate all the countries where it is. If we were talking about South African black people specifically, you'd be right. But in no context is it incorrect that black people in general aren't at the much higher risk for those things. \n\nI explained how you moved the goal posts and even quoted you. First you said I was only talking about African Americans (I wasn't). Then when I showed you Africa had the highest rate you started to compare individual countries. You've got to see how starting with the claim that it's only an African American thing was already wrong from the start. So you shifted the argument. \n\nDo you think if I were to say \"white people have the highest risk of specifically atrial fibrillation\"(they do)  that I'm for some reason claiming that it's all regions and cultures with a white community 100% all aligning with that stat? No way, that would be insane. I'm just saying that it is correct to say white people are more prone to that. The set being looked at is the entire race and I'm being several regions have no higher propensity than anywhere else. Yet in this discussion you decided to compare specific countries.  I didn't start this conversation by even saying Africans. I said black people. That means the sample group were looking at is black people as a whole. It doesn't make sense to then show the specific subsets  where it's different.  They'd be to the far left or right of bell graph of \"rate of risk\" as the outliers.\n\nAs for your other comment,  starting that black people are historically misdiagnosed is absolutely correct. It's why I'm hopeful AI can one day cater medical diagnosis  all the way down to the individual's own risk factors.  Human doctors can only do so much research on every assumption before going ahead and testing for the best first guesses. Though, historical misdiagnosis may have it's roots in a far more unethical place of racism. Some of the things I've seen in past research in the subject really turns my stomach. Nearly as bad is knowing justice was seldom had. AI shouldn't have the same problems.",

But until it's affordable to just run a DNA test and get truly accurate and actionable results then most diagnosis happens with visual identification and an interview on the symptoms.\n\nDo you think a doctor that hears someone describing sickle cell anemia is going to stop them and ask them what country their family is from or just go ahead and test for what it sounds like? That's the way it goes in a legitimate medical practice. \n\nWhen we're discussing statistics, it's different from individual prognosis.  We're able to discuss overall trends. That doesn't magic the person in front of you from having the condition or not having it. **You should never apply aggregate data to the individual as a given.** Stereotyping is stupid in virtually every profession. The reason why aggregate data is valuable goes more towards general research. For example, thanks to knowing the general mapping of sickle cell risk we were able to overlap it with the malarial risks and see the correlation and likely causation. That's important to knowing more about why it developed more than it is just to diagnose the condition.\n\nBut what AI does is it looks at a variety of factors and then gives an odds based diagnosis.  So it might say \"70% confidence level that this is sickle cell\" and that's great if it's using more than just race. Most of it should just be the symptoms list, what the individual told you. This should then lead to a blood test to verify or whittle down the condition to figure out the right one. But it isn't like them being black boosts the confidence level by 20% or something. But it's not wrong for it to be a factor that is considered as part of the percentage of overall confidence. Not considering it would be incorrect.",

Melanin doesn't dissipate ionizing radiation in general, it absorbs short wavelength visible and UV light.\n\nX-rays and gamma rays breeze right on by except for a handful collisions that are broadly dependent on mass and atomic properties.\n\nWhy? Because molecular structure has a much lower impact on xray and gamma absorption than for visible/UV light absorption, and the typical penetration depth is vastly greater.\n\nSo an organic pigment like melanin barely interacts, and when it does interact absorbtion looks pretty similar to other organic material made up of the same atoms.",

The way gene diversity intersects between all lifeforms makes your statement only true depending on how many input values you give to define diversity. The more we learn about genes the more we realize we don't know much about them. If I tell my doctor that I share 60% of my genes with a fruit fly, the statement is true, but not useful. So depending on what you are trying to make genetic diversity mean here...sort of matters. And it kind of seems like although you are right, you probably don't have a deep understanding of what it means.\n\nYou are talking about the result of human migratory patterns giving way to larger gene variation in many groups of humans that stayed in one continental area. But you seem to be using the statement as some sort of gotcha and many are just not following the logic there.",

            "body": "If the AI can *accurately* discern a patient's ethnicity through bone and tissue structure then it stands to reason it is not \"being racist.\" There are very specific markers and variations of tissue and bone structure that correspond to the various environments those patients' ancestors adapted to, even if scientists can't identify any themselves. \n\nThese adaptations also reflect very specific genetic and biological markers for very specific diseases and ailments. So it stands to reason perfectly well that this level of specificity matters, even if we don't feel comfortable with it.\n\nKeep in mind that the relative quick changes in modern society, the last 2000 years or so, don't compare to last 200,000 years of environmental and climatological adaptation. Our bodies have had a very long time to adapt to specific conditions, and an even longer time for those adaptations to take root in our physical structure. That history matters to medical diagnosis.\n\nIf people are concerned that an AI may do something with this information, why? There has to be a specific reason to be biased in the same way humans are in order to do so. That means if an AI learns to be biased, it's because someone intentionally taught it to be. Pure machine logic doesn't work like our logic, it has to be told to do it.\n\nThe biggest problem people have when observing the behavior of Artificial Intelligence (or any form of intelligence for that matter) is that regardless of its origins or composition, they tend to view it through the lense of the Human Condition. That just isn't an accurate way to look at the world if you aren't talking about humans specifically.\n\nThis is just another case of wait and see where it goes, you might be surprised. It could very well significantly advance our understanding of medicine.\n\nBut just to be safe, perhaps don't give this one access to Twitter, yeah?",

You can do it manually I think, but a machine can speed up the process. \n\nOne thing that will slow down science is wokeism. \"Ah, the AI is able to identify that this skeleton is white, black, asian, whatever, we might offend people! We might be empowering stereotypes!\" Oh come on. You feed data to AI, then when the data shows accurate results, you get surprised and \"worried\" because it might feed to stereotypes? Well isn't the point of science using data and evidence in order to get the truth? Science is science. If one race is found to be usually taller than another, is that biased? No, it's simply fact. So what if it will lend to the stereotype that the taller race are basketball players or they're usually great at being athletes? Nothing wrong with that. You're not using this information to do bad things to them like Hitler or some other racist bad guy. Facts are facts, characteristics are characteristics. I don't think science should bow down to worries of being \"offensive\". If facts or data offend people, it's on them. Just because some people want to believe that the earth is flat doesn't make it so.",

They've developed a system which links an unknown set of features of images to a set of labels that the researchers had previously applied to a sample set of images. The system doesn't tell the observer *why* it believes the sample image to correlate with certain labels.\n\nAs an example of potential bias in the training set, if the \"African\" label training set was heavily drawn from hospitals with older, lower resolution imagers perhaps the AI associates low-resolution images with the \"African\" label. Remember that one of the claims in the article is that they used images which had none of the clues that humans usually look for, so we have to figure out what clues the AI found.\n\nThe concern expressed in the article is that the system cannot explain what it found.\n\nAt some point the diagnosis software needs to be able to explain why it makes a decision so that the humans relying on it can determine if the AI is missing something obvious from its training set.\n\nA far better path is to train the AI to recognise features in the various imagery types, and then figure out how those patterns relate to interesting characteristics of the patient's medical condition.",

Race is based on observable characteristics, it's based on averages of many genes and how those affect each individual's appearance. It's not defined by measurements of precisely what genes an individual has, because until recently that information was impossible to acquire and even now it's not like we're fully gene mapping the entire population. But the averages of those genes were observable - just like how you don't have to catalogue every passing photon to make a judgement on whether one light source is brighter than another.\n\nThe observable characteristics associated with each race correlate with other characteristics, so while physical appearance does not purely dictate any other characteristic like propensity for a particular genetic disorder, it is a statistical fact that it indicates non-appearance traits. So long as you believe genetics can affect things besides appearance (it does) and understand the fundamental statistics around genetics and the correlations involved, it would be self-contradictory to claim physically observable race has no correlation to non-physically observable characteristics.",

It would rely on the variables they were using to make the choice. \n\nHumans have biases that they hide from themselves. \n\nAi doesn't. If bias is suspected, the algorithm is tweaked. A good chance that the bias would be detected by another ai. The bias would be corrected by an AI. Likely before any actual choices are made.",

Which yes, it;s objectively racist, and non-scientific.  \n\n\nThat's an entirely different issue as to whether or not people from a given ethnicity share physical traits, which, they do. A simple example is, look up on google images \\`congolese man\\`  then \\`ethiopian man\\`, you will notice that their bodies look very different from each other. It's not racist to aknowledge that black people have dark skin, it;s not racist to acknowledge that asians have slanted eyes, and it;s not racist to acknowledge that different ethnicities have slightly different skeletons. None of this is racist.  \n\n\nAs a matter of fact insisting people are biologically the same IS harmful. Because the medical field has assumed white males are the universal study subject, women and other ethnicites are under represented in medical studies. But different people react differently to drugs, depending on your ethnicity you may need different concentrations or different compounds all together. Things like painkillers for example are not properly callibrated for black people and they often have to endure through pain for no other reason that the science to heal them specifically does not exist. It's a major talking point among black rights activists.",

The AI in the article is probably not going off just one feature, but even if such a feature exists (one that is reliably distinguishable), it still wouldn't go against the idea of their being more variation within races (and groups in general).",

The reason why race shouldn't matter isn't because people aren't different.  It's because they have enough shared experience on the planet that the differences on average should equal out, general characteristics of irrelevant selecting not withstanding (aka nose shape is not likely to make a big difference, so there will be many types of these).  Aka, white people have X pressures to get smarter.  Black people also have X pressures to get smarter.  A given black or white person may be smarter of dumber, but the evolutionary pressures are similar.\n\n\"Individuals of the same race vary more than the races.\"  I will agree with that, and yet we do see racial or tribal physical attribute differences.  In the case of race, it's obviously the kinds of differences we see rather than the extremity of them.  I should note that I am not making a value judgement on the differences, or on peoples observation of them.  Only that they are there.\n\nThis is why eugenics is so dangerous, and yet so appealing.  You could breed out all the flaws and make perfect people.  Maybe.  Or you could screw up the whole race by making really significant changes that would actually cause most humans to be inferior to the new \"supermen\".  That wouldn't be good for anyone.  That's where the supremacists fail to continue their line of reasoning to the end: They just think these new superior (white, ha) people will outbreed / destroy the old inferiors, and everyone will live in peace forever.  That totally wouldn't happen.  The existing humans would most likely kill off these new ones because of the threat they would be.  If that didn't happen, the new ones would kill ALL of the old ones, even the ones that made them because they would recognize the old humans threat to their lives.",

It's been well-established that there is structural racism and unconscious bias in medicine that leads to differential outcomes for white people and people of color. If a model is detecting race from images, then it risks making predictions based on race that propagate the structural racism present in medicine.\n\nHere's an example: hypothetically, let's say that disease X is underdiagnosed in black patients (this could be due to a litany of potential reasons that have nothing to do with the disease itself -- maybe clinicians are taking black patients' symptoms less seriously, maybe black patients are more likely to be treated by less experienced doctors, etc.). If features Y and Z are more prevalent in black patients, the model might learn that features Y and Z are less likely to be associated with disease X, even if those features have nothing to do with the disease process, simply because black patients are less likely to have that disease label. Thus, this type of model could propagate structural bias in medicine, and therein lies the danger.",

Over the past century (and longer of course but that is where we have so much data from), most data in most fields cover white men far more than any other demographic. There is systemic racism that is still being worked to be removed in the world. It\u2019s the same reason why facial recognition works better on European faces, voice assistants understand male voices better, and that only covers 2 biases. With over 200 biases having been identified in humans, the concern is how do you verify an AI doesn\u2019t have unwanted bias? \n\nIn medicine, race is important. Different races are at higher risk for different diseases or conditions, but again, most of our scientific data comes from white men, so we are still learning that.",

Patient is at higher risk of xy disease because they are black\u201d \n\nBut just for the sake of the argument we say an AI can be racist by being able to determine race off bone structure. Then what about sexism. Should we assume an AI is going to be sexist because it can determine sex off bone structure? Can an AI be transphobic by determining that their gender is based off their bone structure? At the end of the day the final decision/verdict will be announced by a doctor and not an AI",

Race has no biological definition.  It's not even a concept in biology the way it's used here.  Race is %100 social, based on loosely on what people *believe to be attributed to regions*.  Which also isn't really true, considering \"white\" could be Spanish all the way to Eastern Russia, up to Sweden, and back down to Greece.  Although, many would argue that the Mediterranean countries aren't \"white\" and that Spaniards aren't white.  \n\nIt doesn't stop there, though.  In a lot of Latin America, there are almost limitless races based on the race of all of your grandparents.  In the US, you're black if you look black.  You could have 3 white grandparents but one black and you are black. Now, that has absolutely nothing to do with geography or specifically what part of the world *you* came from.  \n\nRace is arbitrary.  Which is what leads me to believe this study is accounting for region of family origin and make its arbitrary line on what \"race\" that lineage belongs to.",

It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters. Instead, the Western concept of race must be understood as a classification system that emerged from, and in support of, European colonialism, oppression, and discrimination.\"*\n\n\\-----\n\nEvery country has different definitions for what they define as specific 'races' or even how many there are.\n\nBut hey I'm listening.

They live in terror of finding difference of any kind, because their equality of rights is still based on the idea of a blank slate (that anyone who succeeds is unfairly privileged and that anyone who fails is unfairly disadvantaged). \n\nWhat has been lost in this equation is what Richard Weaver called \"Fraternity\" our commitment to our whole human family in love and duty regardless of any assumption of equality (e.g., a young child is inferior in wisdom to the parent, which is why a parent has duties, but all are love, all are human, and all are helped). What makes you worthy of human dignity is the fact that you are a human being and not that you're IQ meets a certain standard or that you are physically capable or that you are beautiful. Fraternity does not require equality in output, but rather asserts equality in dignity regardless of differences (which we will find if we look closely enough at various demographics).",

It's a value judgement to say that they do matter or to what degree they do, and most people are too fucking cowardly to admit to doing it, even though it's blatantly obvious that they are making these judgements.

            "body": "Racism, sexism, and more are absolutely a concern for AI in medical imaging as they perpetuate the biases of the data they were trained on, which reflects social inequalities in society. The problem is that race is socially constructed, as there is no genetic test to determine a person\u2019s race. However, there are differences in things like bone geometry^1, which will obviously show up in an x-ray. This isn\u2019t an issue per se, as long as the AI used is something like an unsupervised or weakly-supervised computer vision model that identifies unique features and then classifies them based on the combinations of those features.\n\nThe issue here seems to be that the data was annotated with *socioeconomic* information that is correlated with racial inequality, thus introducing racial biases into the model. The fact that x-ray images themselves (which could still be annotated by, say, creating a mask that segments the bones from the rest of the image) can be separated into different groups/classes is not the problem; the model would only be looking at objective data independent of the socioeconomic factors can result in \u201cracist AI\u201d. \n\nIf the model was trained solely on the x-ray images (either unsupervised or weakly-supervised with annotations to help the model identify bones) and did not contain the additional annotations that reflected racial biases, it should be no surprise that AI can \u201cidentify a person\u2019s race\u201d (and to be clear, that\u2019s not what the model would technically do. Computers have no notion of the concept of race. It\u2019s *humans* that are interpreting the model\u2019s classifications of an x-ray in terms of race, and introducing racial biases to the model in the process).\n\nFor some extra background and context, I co-authored a published paper on the use of weakly-supervised convolutional neural networks for blood vessel segmentation. The only annotations we used to train our model were manually-drawn masks over the blood vessels. I have no idea why any other kind of annotation other than segmentation masks of the bones would be needed for the classification of x-rays as described in the article, let alone annotations that have nothing to do with the x-ray images themselves, which in this case would only introduce racial biases into the model.\n\nTL;DR: The researchers shouldn\u2019t have labeled the x-rays with the race of the person. But they did, and then were surprised and concerned when the model did what they trained it to do. This is why weakly-supervised or unsupervised neural networks should be used when applying AI to medical imaging in cases like this.\n\n1.\t[Ethnic Differences in Bone Geometry between White, Black and South Asian Men in the UK](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004623/)",

Biased data produces biased algorithms. That's machine learning 101.\n\nThat's where the concern comes from. If the algorithm can identify something on a sample that lacks the information to accurately identify (like the partial and corrupted samples here) it, it can mean one of two things: Either your algorithm found a hidden variable that you didn't account for, or, much more likely, your dataset is bad and your algorithm is worthless.",

I specifically didn't have her as one of my instructors, but I had seen her around the department. It wasn't until my capstone class that she did a presentation on her \"project\".\n\nWhen she announced this, my jaw hit the table. Craniometry vastly influenced eugenics and was dismissed as a pseudoscience along with phrenology and physiognomy. While it does have some applications in other species, humans simply have more variation than other animals. Variation referring to color, size and shape, with shape also being influenced by use and sometimes intentional modification.\n\nRegardless, I couldn't resist asking how her research was going. She told us about a cold case she was trying to assist on. Her data was leading her to believe the John Doe was from Samoa or one of the Pacific Islands. The JD was found in Central Iowa in the U.S., which led her to learn there's less than 100 people in the state that fit that description and none were missing. I would later learn thru a different professor the JD was later discovered via DNA analysis to be a white man of European descent. \n\nHowever she ended that story by asking me if I wouldn't mind having my head measured for her research. I asked if it would show my Easter Island ancestry. She was undoubtedly surprised in her reaction (I look like a typical white non hispanic American). 3 professors burst out laughing as we had an inside joke (I have a massive head, like hard to find a football helmet that fits kinda big). I had to explain to her my strong resemblance to a Moai. No one clapped as it was a terrible joke to begin with. She's not currently working at my university.",

That is because I think the comments are annoyed about how the title seems to ignore objective needs of the medical field concerning different treatments for different races. \n\nMaybe, the scientists were not concerned about this issue of an AI acknowledging different races with just X-RAYs because it is obvious that different races have different methods of treatments in specific circumstances. Maybe, the concern was more subjective in nature. Perhaps, scientists in this study concluded that the medical care could become similarly prejudiced as the medical care contemporary in our society. Human medical care does have bias when it comes to addressing medical needs of the minorities in our society. An imagined example would be a doctor ordering tests for a person in the majority of society and waving off another person in the minority of society, despite having the same symptoms. \n\nBecause the human mind is often unimaginably unbiased, these scientists may have became \u201cconcerned\u201d because there was a possibility for the biases that appear in human medical care to spawn in AI medical care. \n\nThat\u2019s my two cents, I\u2019d like to have discussions that counter-argue in a meaningful way.
