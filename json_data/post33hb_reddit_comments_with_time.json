Then society regresses toward tribalism (or some might say Balkanization).  Once that happens there is increased strife, hate, inequality, crime, etc.\n\nAll that allows a government (or a party or some group of people - like the U.N.) to basically do whatever they want.  The population is busy just trying to survive their everyday lives, and it will growing resentful of others, society, etc.  It also lays the foundation for the government, or whatever group has enough power, to implement a police state, fascism, a kleptocracy, etc, etc, etc.\n\nThere are plenty of other ways that more people equals more power.  This is just one small example within the U.S. - look at what the Democrats did with sanctuary cities and states.  They encouraged illegal immigrants to come into the country and to their states.  This accomplished several things.  First, increased the population base.  Then the Dems voted to insure that the census had to include all residents (not just citizens).  That increase gives them more representatives in the House.  Second, it gets them more federal funding.  Most people think of that in terms of welfare but actually there's lots and lots of avenues to get more of the federal government's disbursements.  Then if issues arise with illegal immigrants the first thing they do is get special allocations (more money) from the federal government.\n\nAlso, in a wartime scenario more people equals more bodies to throw at the enemy.   \nOr in an agricultural / pre-automated / pre-AI society more people = more power due to more production power.\n\nBut you are also correct in that technological innovation works as well too.  Especially in today's disinformation age.",

            "body": "This cycle has happened before and will happen again. Industrial Revolution killed any jobs that could be done by a machine and those workers had to quickly adapt to finding a new source of income usually working on an assembly line or maintaining the machines, etc. war time comes around and the job market needs people as 70 million people die in WW2 and a reset happens where people are making money and can afford to not work 70 hours a week.\n\nAutomation happens, stuff like coffee shops, grocery stores, distribution centers, public transit drivers become automated and we put value on those stores that keep human talent and interaction (Walmart and Trader Joe\u2019s). But unlike war which started a great boom in the economy and reset a bunch of lives by killing them off, this time I imagine conditions will be a negative feedback loop where like you see now, people work where they can, they can\u2019t afford to buy goods and products they need, companies lay off workers in return of lost sales rather than increase wages, and again the cycle continues. You also see a decrease in fertility in turn and after if it\u2019s UBI or an automation tax, who knows.\n\nAlso outside of the private sector the government  would also cut off jobs or just refuse to replace retired workers because some computer can do it. Like the military for example, which is the largest public employer in the US but even they are laying off roles.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a Devin AI means bye bye one of the most skilled sectors in the market this is like 40-50 years down because right now AI isn\u2019t artificial nor is it intelligent",

This way we keep the power of an employees contract in the hands of the employee and not the employer who can just see you as easily replaceable. This way we need less food to sustain our lifestyles. Our healthcare systems won't be so busy. It would be so much easier to find a place to live.\n\nIronically one of the best things to happen to Europe in the middle ages was the black death.

It only gets that way when you consider how companies in certain industries get away with not offering anything like a real wage to locals, then dangle the reality of coming to America at any wage before a foreign worker. \n\nCovid showed that out. It happened down the road at this huge ski resort. They used not to try and pay more than $12 an hour. They relied heavily on J1B's ,or whatever those visas are called. Then Covid hit, and their corporate minimum wage is now $20. \n\nIt had to, or in the new world no one would work for them. Fortunately, the company realized that ahead of the curve and responded with a wage increase before there was too much of a fight. Because, you know, unions. Above all, they don't want unions.",
