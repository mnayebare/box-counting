In software for example, quality is never as high as it should be, the rush for new features causes short cuts to be taken, bugs to get thrown on a tech debt pile and never fixed, there are integrations between platforms h to at should happen but can\u2019t because it\u2019s not commercially feasible.\n\nWithout automation it would not be feasible to enjoy what you do today, things like advanced phones, app stores, gigabit internet are fast wireless. Historically, every time we increase productive capacity, we just set a new baseline for consumption.\n\nI don\u2019t have an opinion yet on whether it\u2019s ultimately better or worse for society in terms of joblessness, but either way a change to societies expectations on the quality, volume and availability of goods or a change to expected working hours, we could certainly use up the new productive capacity.",

So yes, the creation of new phones did remove a lot of jobs. Maybe not then, but it sure is now. Self-Check outs allow more shoplifting. Which will continue in the future especially the way the gatekeepers and the rich are thinking. No one is safe from anything unless you\u2019re educated. Or, can that become an issue? How many federal employees have lost their jobs temporarily only for the president to reinstate them. I don\u2019t think anyone is safe in America. Who\u2019s to say that eventually those who go into their future careers with AI analysis and AI Data to name a few if they don\u2019t become displaced? I can see it happening. Those that are safe are those who integrate AI into their jobs not those who help create and make them. They\u2019re the cause why jobs displacements happen.",

There are three jobs that he feels will be effective and all other job markets lost. It involves technology and engineering. So, look into that and determine what I just seen on the Stephen Colbert show. Also, read more, I did some research and followed up on it. So, if you disagree with bill gates but okay. It will displace humans and all those who the billionaires paid to help create it. It will not take over effectively right away but it will gradually take over through time. I know what I heard this man say from my own eyes by watching and I know what I read was credible as it did have references. There are still educated people out here. Educated enough to speak the truth and tell the people that they will no longer be needed instead of sugarcoating it and making it seem as if it was the best thing that ever happened. That best thing was when King James authorized the Bible to be written in English so we can actually see what was coming. The lord beat you all to creation. You can\u2019t recreate it. What you retreat is only a replication of the original that\u2019s why it\u2019s called Artificial Intelligence. The moment you think you can supercede the most high you got another thing coming. Like I said, not to get all in faith and religion but the rulers of this world lord. The Bible is true and it speaks on this. Wow! Glad I learned as a teenager. That way I can effectively lead people. I tell them the truth. There should be no reason to lie. Bill Gates said it will displace people. I believe him because I already knew. It might replace software workers. Why? You give it the intelligence to mimic what you have done. It\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s a shame. Keep in that field though. It will help you in the future but it will only last for so long. Knowing that AI is already bias further let\u2019s me know those creating it is bias. Amazing how God works. The original creator did not crest biases men crated them. The same as he will create Artificial Intelligence that is not original. Regardless of why it can do, I taught my children how to survive in this life but not get entangled with that nonsense. Learn it, use it to your advantage not theirs. I think my family has that mind concept. How effective we will be in the future with Education, Faith, and Artificial Intelligence. A benefit for those who are planned to lose . We learn ahead.",

Practices changed, pipelines are triggered automatically etc etc. But the actual tools to produce code didn't evolve much at all. \n\nNow I can tell a bot that I need a software that has this and that API, uses this and that database, keeps change log of every change, supports different branches of data and give it example data and it does what I asked for. Maybe not perfectly yet and maybe not the way I would have done everything, but this would have been unthinkable 5 years ago, even 2 years ago it seemed like a pipedream, now it is here, or almost here.",

I\u2019m interested in problems related to clouds, turbulence, and radiation. One of the main reasons we need to know that stuff is in order to build better approximations of those processes into our weather and climate models. But now AI-enhanced weather forecasting models are starting to outperform the traditional methods without \u201cknowing\u201d anything about the physics.

Historically, major technological shifts eliminated old jobs but also created new industries, printing presses displaced scribes, industrial machines reduced manual labor, but both ultimately led to massive expansions in economic opportunity.\n\nThe real question might not be \u201cWill AI take more jobs than it creates?\u201d but rather:\n\nWho benefits from AI-driven productivity?\nIf AI makes companies richer while displacing workers, is that technological progress or just concentrated wealth replacing distributed opportunity?

Are we investing in AI-driven innovation that leads to new industries, or just using AI to reduce labor costs in existing ones? Could we be aiming for a future where AI enhances human creativity and productivity instead of just replacing tasks?\n\nAre we preparing people for an AI-driven economy?\nA strong society doesn\u2019t just let change happen, it adapts and prepares its people to lead it.

            "body": "There are many jobs ai cannot replace. I\u2019m glad about that. Instead of being worried about ai creating jobs be concerned with the crime rate that will happen to those that have those jobs and those that do not. I encourage everyone to go into healthcare, criminal justice, religious studies, social work. Ai can work along side but not take over because of the human emotions as I was reading. People are excited about new jobs. What new jobs will it create? Ai data analysis, data info. How scary! As I stated before once war comes to America this time they will not succeed. With AI, traditional wars are thrown out the picture. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to those so happy about Ai that when a war starts and they have those drones and kill you where you stand. I don\u2019t think that wood be amazing and exciting on crating new jobs. Multiple drones in the air shooting everywhere how can you as an individual protect you? Even if you do understand ai and work with it, how can you stop those drones for shooting. I keep telling people this only the beginning of your sorrows. How can your children work? Train them in AI and there is no longer a set age to work? Come on now? Canada is a place to move to or England. Canada has AI research but hasn\u2019t mainly adopted ai yet. England believes it should help enhance workers not displace them. Unfortunately, this is not America. America wants to displace you. The billionaires that have been doing this research way before any of us was born. Right now? I wouldn\u2019t care what anyone thought who supported ai. It would go in one ear and out the other because when it replicates your intelligence and displace you. I wonder how you will feel about that one. Trump has already fired Federal Workers what do any of you think is going to be good? I have my career in criminal justice set as I am currently enrolled now. I\u2019m beating them before 2030. I will be done with my degree is in 2027. Can\u2019t wait either. I\u2019m taking my tail elsewhere where the country considers its people and not its pocket. You help make America the way it is now by working blood, sweat, and tears. How dare you fold and allow someone to run you over like that. Starting the process of my dual citizenship next year for me and my children. Good-bye America. I can\u2019t live anywhere where the rich are more important than the workers. I\u2019m going to a country that considers its people. Think this a joke and keep believing that you will be sufficient in the future. That comes with a lot of dedication and time to someone who you have no say with. Go into business and journalism. AI can process data but it cannot take over the human relatedness of emotions or will it? The moment AI becomes smarter than you? You need to question your government on why AI a robot, is more important than a human. I\u2019m glad I was raised in faith. Everything that I thought was a lie the Bible now speaks as the truth. Everything is unfolding right before your eyes. A lawless generation, poverty, inflation. The Bible spoke it. Not only that, I would definitely not pay a person any kind who tried to find a way to discredit this post. Why? Because, I know you will eventually find out when it\u2019s too late. Listen to Bernie Sanders these people are speaking truths. America cares nothing about its citizens. It cares about getting rich. How will people survive that don\u2019t have an education? Consider you grandparents, especially minorities. They were less likely to get an education and some races other than minorities. How till they survive? When people are not working, what about crime? More people with jobs are unsafe because they will know you because of the change in the economy. Will social security still exist? I guess you work until you die? Wow? That\u2019s a country that cares about you? What about UBI? Will they put that into play? If not, I fear for those who have these jobs, you might need a personal bodyguard because you\u2019re at risk all the time. Man, I\u2019m not raising my children in this country. I\u2019m taking my kids abroad. After I get the $2,000 something odd dollars. I\u2019m renouncing my citizenship. I don\u2019t want no parts of America and no ties to it. I should have started sooner. I\u2019m getting started next year and hopefully I\u2019m out of here before 2030. No, there\u2019s is no hope I will definitely be. I\u2019m looking into going to school in Canada. I\u2019m thinking about transferring my credits if possible to there and live abroad. This country is on the brink of chaos and disorder. That\u2019s not including all the allies turned enemies we have. AI won\u2019t be able to protect you on that. China leads and they will continue to lead.",

We must own those tools - like all the other tools. It's essential.\n\nThe exploitation of workers must cease, and it's a shame that everyone is now convinced that work is in itself a virtue, while it's nothing else than an obstacle between us and what we want. Sadly, a lot of people feel personally attacked when you evoke the idea that they might not have to work anymore, and that it would be a good thing.\n\nBut somehow they can't wait for their weekend/vacations/retirement to arrive.",
