What I do think the internet and AI will polarize the world. \n\nWe already kind of see this with respect to national attitudes to 5G. We could see \"seperate spheres\" for China, Europe, America, etc as digital tech gets more engrained in our lives and governments do or don't regulate it. \n\nIn regards to liberal democracy, the democratization of information is having a really interesting and scary kaleidoscopic effect on the way truth is perceived that reminds me of the way truth is spoken of at the end of *1984*.\n\nThat said, Liberal Democracy thrives on information, and the internet is the ultimate font of that. If we can avoid the fracturing of truth, citizens have easy, rapid access to facts, which should be a huge boon to democracy. That said, it could have the opposite effect, overwhelming voters and causing the wearieness and Toquevillian individualism de Toqueville presciently observed in his work. \n\nSo, I think it more than anything depends on the way people use it. If they fail to stand up and take an active interest in their governance, Liberal Democracy will fall. If they do take an active role, Liberal Democracy may enter an unparallelled golden age. Ultimately, its the same conflict democracy has always had, with some new ridiculously powerful plot devices added in.",

Unfortunately that is a really hard problem to solve, and AI technologies have even exacerbated existing issues in some ways, e.g. deepfakes and information bubbles. The task of telling the public what is and isn't trustworthy is a *hard problem* which we traditionally gave to journalists, but the volume of information out there today makes it a staggering task.",

It seems to be self-serving for \u201cdeep-state\u201d agencies where they are able to mount surreptitious surveillance programs which are intrinsically protected by the nature of representative government. I mean as long as classified information exists and citizens can\u2019t know things at the very least because other countries can\u2019t, then we will see this arms race of citizen activism against surveillance. It\u2019d be much like an invisible war since we practically lucked into finding out about the NSA\u2019s program a decade ago.\n\nAt the end of the day, directly grabbing data from people still needs a subpoena and if it involves the court at all, you are shooting yourself in the foot if you didn\u2019t follow judicial protocol. And at that point, it almost misses the need for surveillance. So then it leaves spying internationally and extra-judicial operations on US citizens/foreigners in the US.\n\nIt feels like surveillance is only truly frightening if you\u2019re a progressive, but you would have the tools to fight against it. *As an aside, I\u2019m aware of how alt-righters and right wingers cite 1984 as a depiction of \u201cthe left\u201d to great irony so I\u2019m sticking with what I said*.",

I also think that, as clich\u00e9 as this is to say, information is the currency of the 21st century just as much as money. The tendency for corporations and governments to surveil is a natural consequence of the ability to do so, because the benefits to whatever body decides to collect that information are HUGE, and the disadvantages to not collecting informstion in the face of other bodies doing that are quite possibly fatal to the non-surveilling body. \n\nThe advantages of collecting that information is, uncontestably, prediction. With that information, you can predict the future within a certain margain of error. That ability to predict the future, I think, is a tightrope of sorts to walk, because the temptation to act on things that haven't happened yet, or act to prevent hypothetical events, is a quick slide down into authoritarianism. \n\nBut as I said above, it depends on the people that use the technology, and how. The game is the same as it always has been, just with much, much higher stakes.",

Without those laws, eventually people have to fall back on costumes and those could be outlawed, see in London where people are fined and have their picture taken by police for trying to avoid facial recognition zones. Even IR emitting jewelry can be beaten by cameras designed to not see infrared.\n\nPhysical automation made a lot of physical jobs obsolete, but created different jobs controlling the machines.\n\nMachine learning advances are making it possible to remove some of those control jobs, and will replace other control jobs as it gets better (already AI algorithms are better at finding existing legal precedent than humans). And better control machines can enable new types of physical labor to be automated (e.g. picking delicate produce).\n\nThe result will be furthering the inequity gap between \"The Haves\" (people with producing assets) and \"The Have Nots\" (everyone else). And eventually the Have Nots will not be able to afford things. The lack of \"able to pay\" demand would encourage companies to scale back production (so engage in artificial scarcity). It would be lead to a collapse of society as the Have Nots have to find alternative ways to house, feed, and cloth themselves (either go to a gray market of barter or spread out and try to farm without access to water utilities they can't afford).\n\nThe end result is that the only stable countries would be ones that:\n\n1. Engage in aggressive redistributive policy (beyond providing income for basic needs), and\n\n2. Proactively respond to attempts by asset owners to protest or enact an \"Atlas Shrugged\" strategy by using eminent domain laws to seize assets deliberately left unused (be they land, infrastructure, or IP).",

This production increase results in new higher paying jobs, and the cycle continues.\n\nLower prices don't matter if people have no money in the first place. \"Demand\" doesn't mean \"How many people want something.\" It means \"How many people **that can pay for it** want something.\" During recessions, companies cut back production because they don't want a ton of excess inventory that they can't sell (and they spent money on materials and labor to make).\n\nAnd while it is true that innovation have lead to higher paying jobs, they have always been **proportionally fewer** higher paying jobs than they replaced.\n\nAnd prior to now we haven't had machines capable of doing \"high skill work\" better than humans. But we now do have robots that do research better (as long as they have a database of partitioned entries).\n\nIt is why the current step 1 for doing legal research is to have a robot do a contextual search. The false negative (missing a case) and false positive (flagging unrelated cases) rates have gotten *really* low.\n\nAll history points to automation widening the inequity gap. There is no reason to expect that trend to change without proactive government intervention.",

We use novel panel data on robot adoption within industries in seventeen countries from 1993 to 2007 and new instrumental variables that rely on robots\u2019 comparative advantage in specific tasks. Our findings suggest that increased robot use contributed approximately 0.36 percentage points to annual labor productivity growth, while at the same time raising total factor productivity and lowering output prices. Our estimates also suggest that **robots did not significantly reduce total employment**, although they did reduce low-skilled workers\u2019 employment share.\n\nLikewise, [this](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3066052) study from the ITIF agrees with me.\n\n>Second, many believe that if innovation only accelerates even more then new jobs in new industries and occupations will make up for any technology-created losses. But the truth is that growth in already existing occupations is what more than makes up the difference. In no decade has technology directly created more jobs than it has eliminated. Yet, throughout most of the period from 1850 to present, the U.S. economy as a whole has created jobs at a robust rate, and unemployment has been low. **This is because most job creation that is not explained by population growth has stemmed from productivity-driven increases in purchasing power for consumers and businesses. Such innovation allows workers and firms to produce more, so wages go up and prices go down, which increases spending, which in turn creates more jobs in new occupations, though more so in existing occupations (from cashiers to nurses and doctors).** There is simply no reason to believe that this dynamic will change in the future for the simple reason that consumer wants are far from satisfied.",

And as such, it can be used for better or for worse.\n\nTake, for example, AI used on social media platforms. As it is now, algorithms mainly promote the creation of echo-chambers by feeding people content that aligns closely with their own views. It is very profitable for tech companies because people tend to spend more time in their echo-chambers and the goal of social media platforms is to keep users engaged close to 100% of time. This is not very good for people or for democracy due to polarisation, radicalisation, and related phenomena.\n\nNow, imagine that the very same social platforms used AI to mark trustworthiness of the information, suggest in-depth articles on currently debated topics, inform about alternative views, and so on. This would, probably, be less profitable for the business and less psychologically comfortable for users, but this might reduce echo-chamber effects and help people to be well-informed in regard to most pressing and relevant issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrivate data collection can also be put to good use. For example, an analysis of social media profiles might help to prevent psychological problems. Modern algorithms can sift through enormous datasets and can find connections that are easy to miss for humans. If there are any subtle indicators for depression, domestic violence/abuse, suicide AI can find and identify it and then send a victim some helpful information, a contact of a support group, or even notify a human professional in an extreme case. Moreover, most of this can be accomplished in an absolutely anonymous, private way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAI can also be instrumental in transitioning to true democracies, especially if a country desires to build a direct democracy. It is much easier for citizens to stay engaged if they have a helper that can summarise the issues for them, provide links to the relevant information, and keep tabs on various politicians and government policies. An AI can also be used to analyse the impacts of various proposals on people and their lives. It would also force politicians to come up with real proposals as opposed to slogans and wish lists.\n\nImagine that you can have a tax debate based on figures that apply directly to you, so you can immediately see how your income would change and what you would get for your money. I think it would be much easier for you to make a decision. It would be also easier to hold your representative and government accountable.\n\nOf course, something like this requires a little bit more advanced AI than what we have now. But it is not something unachievable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for autocracies and democracies, there are not many differences in the potential benefits of AI. It will all depend on the creativity and skill of those who use this tool. Just do not think that people who do not live in democratic societies are somehow less creative. They are not. It very well may be that they are more creative because they have to live in much more restrictive environments.",

For example, an AI can check publications by Dr A in peer-reviewed journals and how often those publications were cited by other authors (this is easily accessible data even in paid databases). Based on results, the AI can add a tag (or several) that would characterise Dr A as a real deal or a fraud.\n\nOf course, something like this is much easier to do for published authors than for politicians, for example.

It's not that easy to classify a post with regards to what fields of expertise will be relevant there, sometimes even for a human. And even within one field there are many subdomains, but a scientist may be an expert in only one or two of them. On top of that, being an expert in a field doesn't necessarily mean that everything I say about that field will be verifiably accurate.\n\nSharing and retweeting makes things even more murky. It might be that something gets shared by an \"expert\" even though it has some falsehoods within it. Does that mean the expert endorses the falsehoods too, or just the headline he read? Experts with thousands of followers can quickly spread lies even unwittingly.",

Urban areas are micro management and planning. People move here because of established institutions, which need to be regulated to some degree because of the scope of inhabitants.\n\n>on the article\n\nI feel this bolsters my point that echo chambers are intrinsic to people, that it is closely related to your upbringing in either an urban or rural area. That AI and technology are not antithetical to political discourse.\n\n>women\n\nThe main feminist proponents, sure. They had developed opinions, but they were by and far the outlier. Really I\u2019m just drawing from my cursory memory of 2nd wave feminists rallying for alimony to be abolished because it intrinsically represented, in practicality and metaphor, that women were dependent on men and this being rejected enmasse. White women in America have historically just touted the values of the head of the household. I mean this isn\u2019t that far fetched. \n\nI mean white women in America vote predominately Republican. They literally vote for what represents the status quo at best and reactionary politics at worst. Is it so much an opinion if it\u2019s just something you\u2019re assigned?",

While parties changed their views on many issues, sometimes to complete opposite, their positions were consistently aligned with the interests either of big business or the non-big business voters.\n\nFor example, the Republican party changed from supporting a big federal government with huge spending and big public projects to opposing the big federal government and public spending. This change happened around the 1930s-1940s. It is also 'the party of Lincoln' that fought for the emancipation of slaves (which was beneficial for the North and the industries) but nowadays it fights against minorities (because inclusiveness and diversification of voters threatens the status quo).\n\nThese shifts in positions align perfectly with the interests of big business. The party was fond of the federal government when the business needed to build infrastructure and educate workers, protect investments and intellectual property. However, once those goals are accomplished and big business is sufficiently big to protect itself the federal government with its taxes and regulations becomes an inconvenience. So, the Republican party changes its tune and starts to argue for smaller government, deregulation, and so on.\n\nOf course, this mostly describes general trends. Individual politicians may deviate from this trend. And, as I said earlier, positions on social issues align better with the urban-rural divide.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI do not think that we are in disagreement about people. We only differ in our opinions on AI's contribution to creation, promotion, and sustainability of the echo-chambers.\n\nI also fully agree that AI and technology are not antithetical to political discourse. My main contention was that AI is a tool and nothing more. It is not inherently good or bad. However, I do not think that the current use of AI on social media platforms is beneficial. And I am [not alone](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/07/65984/deepmind-is-asking-how-google-helped-turn-the-internet-into-an-echo-chamber/) in this opinion.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nWhy does it count for an opinion only if it is different than a tradition or one's family? Do you apply the same standard to men?\n\nI also think that the alimony example is a bad one. Of course, any sensible woman would reject the idea of abolishing alimonies considering how the society worked at that time and still works now. There is nothing wrong in grounding one's opinions in reality. Being a single mother is one of the best predictors of poverty even today.",

I guess my point is I feel women in general have only recently been immersed in issues which they can field their own experiences from to make normative claims about policy.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just my Trump hate talking, but I find it hard to take seriously republican women. It generally just feels like stockholm syndrome.\n\nEdit: actually, generally I feel most people who vote in elections don\u2019t have a genuine opinion. Myself, I\u2019m up in the air on whether I\u2019m actually autonomous or just groomed. At this stage I\u2019d venture to say voting is just data collection of simple socio economic trends. The closer we get to economic equality reflects us getting closer to people having genuine opinions.\n\nBut truthfully I could just be horribly sexist towards women from rural communities. And I\u2019m just picking and choosing when to assign agency so I can avoid assigning moral blame to women who reiterate Republican talking points.",

Our current systems reward those who can rally voters, those who are good public speakers, those who interview well, etc., when all the data we have shows that we are pretty poor predictors of performance in a position, whether hired, appointed, or elected. An example he gives that really hit for me (amongst his many others) is to ask someone if American President have been elected democratically, and I believe someone says yes, but then he asks how many Presidents have been women, and the person says zero, and then asks what percentage would have been women in this lottery system, and he says 50%. So if America were truly democratic and actually selected candidates that represented its people, we would see it. I honestly feel like AI could help us achieve the true representation for all that we want through providing the tools by which we could make such ideas work, but I have a much lower understanding of the AI principles than most of you (I\u2019m just a college English instructor with a wide variety of interest that are quite interdisciplinary know nature).",

It could be possible to write a law that facial recognition couldn't be used in any way by law enforcement or national security apparatuses. \n\nBut that misses the point. In a democracy, fundamental values are at odds with e.g. facial recognition which could be an extremely useful tool to the government. The existence of facial recognition gives autocracies, which don't care about privacy or personal liberties, an asymmetric advantage over democracies. Democracies must either handcuff themselves or forfeit a part of their identity. Stacking enough of these systemic advantages together will mean that autocracies are more powerful than democracies in the future, and there will be a greater and greater chance of democracies slipping into totalitarianism. Unless there is a counteracting technological force pulling governments towards democracy, I don't see how that trend is avoidable.\n\n> Facial recognition works best for white men. Works much more poorly for very dark-skinned males and females (which would include Australian aboriginees, melanesians in addition to sub-Saharan Africans and African-Americans).\n\nThis is a temporary problem. An engineering issue. Facial recognition also used to have a hard time distinguishing between Asian faces, but China quickly worked that out. There's no law of nature that says facial recognition can never be effective.\n\n> Could autocracies benefit from AI with intrusive data collection? Possibly, but likely in ways those in democracies view as weaknesses of autocracies.\n\nI'm not exactly sure what you mean by this. Do you mean that collecting large amounts of data about a country's population makes that country weaker?",

How does collecting LOTS of data on a given country's inhabitants IMPROVE that country's security from external threats? In simplistic terms, would facial recognition have prevented 9/11 if the INTENT of the airplane-bombers had been unknown?\n\nSo, can facial recognition (FR) be used to find known terrorists?

Are those advantages from the perspective of democracies or rather the citizens of those democracies?\n\nFrom the perspective of a totalitarian government, this allows them to further entrench their power, and reduces the risk of popular uprisings or any other forms of instability. Mass surveillance becomes orders of magnitude less expensive when you don\u2019t need to hire humans to follow citizens one by one.\n\n>\tAutocracies ALREADY have far more control of their OWN PEOPLE than democracies, this far more INTERNAL power. Would AI and facial recognition somehow transform that into insurmountable power autocrices could exploit EXTERNALLY? How?\n\nEvery dollar spent on internal stability and police action is a dollar not spent on military or infrastructure or anything else. So even from a birds eye view this gives a major systemic advantage to a government which can maintain peace cheaply. Additionally, domestic unrest is expensive when you consider the damage it can cause. Riots are expensive, and while people are rioting they\u2019re not working. Finally, any internal unrest draws attention and resources away from international issues. Russia has been accused of contributing to unrest in the US, and the US was accused of doing the same in Hong Kong.\n\n>\tKindly explain how the US would be at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis China with respect to AI.\n\nSure. The US does not have the same kind of national security law that China does. This means that the US does not force companies or individuals to do national security work for them. Google, which employs some of the leading AI researchers, was allowed to discontinue working on Project Maven due to personal political inclinations against autonomous weapons systems. Such a thing would never happen in China. Chinese AI researchers also command higher salaries than American researchers on average, which attracts foreign researchers as part of their Thousand Talents Plan.\n\n>\tYes, indeed, if that data REDUCES individuals' freedom. How does collecting LOTS of data on a given country's inhabitants IMPROVE that country's security from external threats?\n\nIt seems like you\u2019re equating national power and security with having individual liberties, which I don\u2019t see as the case. But again, China is a very safe country. Violent crimes are extremely rare especially when compared to neighbors like Vietnam or Thailand. Their answer to terrorism has been to incarcerate over a million Muslims, without even the accusation of a crime. And there\u2019s no one to question their draconian measures.\n\n>\tSo, can facial recognition (FR) be used to find known terrorists?\n\nI don\u2019t want you to get hung up on FR and terrorism because that\u2019s not really what this is about. FR is just one technology, terrorism is just one category of crime. You can track people in a myriad of other ways. There are many other kinds of threats. What\u2019s important is the paradigm of peace through absolute control, which becomes more and more possible by the day.",

I grant you that. Whether that type of efficiency would be of any value to democracies is unlikely (to be charitable). Thus the distinction I'm trying to make: authoritarians and democracies want different things, so it shouldn't be surprising that autoritarians could derive value from some tools which would be of far less value to democracies.\n\nIOW, no, democracies may not benefit from doing everything authoritarians do.",
