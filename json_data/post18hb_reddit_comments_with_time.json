If there is over $250 in there and I have a withdrawal due, I withdraw it. That's usually every 3 days.  I can't think of a good reason to leave that much money in there, it would take a fair amount of time to rack that up, certainly more than 3 days!  I trust DA as I have never had an issue working for them or being paid, ever, but I wouldn't leave $6k in there. I wouldn't leave that in PayPal.  If it's not paying something the only place for it is in a bank account earning interest ($300 a year at 5%)",

Without knowing more about the people who were locked out, there's no way of knowing if it was remotely legitimate removal or not... having that much money in the hopper makes me suspicious because if it was earned in a short time it is either a result of churning a bunch of low quality work out or lying/cheating. If it was over a long period of time, why did they leave it to sit so long? What period was it earned in, was it sitting for a couple of weeks or more?\n\nIf they did 8 hours a day on $40/hour projects they would only have $2,240 after a week - and 8 hours a day/7 days a week would be a challenge to maintain with high quality work the entire time. Not saying it can't be done, but it's work.   \n\n\nI've heard of folks getting booted with no warning, but the only anecdotes I've read from the bootees involved bad work practices (using AI to generate the answers, for example). People who just did low quality work still got to remove their funds but didn't get access to more projects.",

Likewise if they are over reporting their time to such an extent that an immediate ban is necessary, then they would not be given access to those funds as they didn\u2019t actually earn them. If it were a simple case of underperforming, they\u2019d be given access to withdraw their funds.

That's why it is a bad thing, it isn't possible to do.

So they obviously have AI-scanning software looking for common turns of phrase, the programs exist that check for plagiarism. \n\nAlso, working on multiple projects simultaneously is against the TOS. If it's a bad thing doesn't really matter, although I agree with u/ManyARiver that you *can't* do two fact-checking projects simultaneously or write two prompts at the same time (so say you're working from 12-2: you shouldn't be able to report that as 4 hours of fact checking: you were looking up one thing at a time regardless of which one you were working on). But even if you COULD do both, if you break the TOS of a site you're responsible for that, just like if you did something that wasn't allowed at any workplace. \n\nI've had workplaces that didn't allow us to DOODLE.  Did it make any sense if we were getting our work done? No! Have I gotten warnings for stuff like that? Yes. So my perspective is, if you wouldn't push things at a regular job, don't do it at a WFH/remote. Sort of ESPECIALLY, because they don't know you.",

Why would you ever leave such a large sum of money in an unsecured location? Yeah, I guess people could have been more sympathetic towards OP. But it seems that they believe it's more likely that OP fucked up because of how rigorous (read: anal) the site is in general.\n\nEdit: To add; if my\u00a0friend left $100 bill on a park bench and lost it, then I am definitely calling him an idiot. I'm not blaming him though, because obviously the real thief is out there, but that doesn't make my friend any smarter. If he starts throwing a tantrum because I \"victim-blamed\" him, well, I don't know, I guess I'd argue we're all victims of something since this world is out to get us anyway.",

We can even see it in action in highly pro-social countries like Japan where that money will almost always be handed in somewhere.

It's kind of jumping the gun to start pointing fingers right away when we have nothing but a random reddit post to go off of. So on that front, I am pretty sure we do disagree.\n\nPeople do seem overly protective of this platform, and I can see that it has formed something of a cult. But from what I can tell, it has also somehow built up a reputation of being reliable in terms of withdrawals, so I can understand people's attitude in the comments.",

So THATS why we accumulated so much and lost it all. Because it\u2019s complicated. Some people have bills and need Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday\u2019s wages to pay those bills. So we\u2019d have to accumulate nearly two weeks of wages without cashing out in order to cash out the full amount one may need for those bills if that makes sense. You can only cash out once every 3 days, hourly tasks are paid out every 7 days (which this money is deposited into your account). Let\u2019s say it\u2019s been 7 days and you get your wages from the day you worked 7 days ago, but you just cashed out yesterday. You now have to wait 3 more days to cash-out the wages you earned 7 days ago. And if you work every day with high paying hourly tasks, it adds up quickly. I lost $1256 bucks for a week and two days worth of work before getting \u201cbanned\u201d for no reason. It\u2019s not as easy as work, and get paid 3 days later. If you worked there, you\u2019d understand. It\u2019s just not as simple as it may seem or not as simple as they make it seem.\u00a0",

Hourly projects are paid out 7 days after completion. If you work on a Monday, let\u2019s say, and go to cash out the next Monday, then you can! UNLESS you JUST cashed out on Sunday, which would then mean you now have to wait until Wednesday to cash out for the previous Mondays work. And by cash out I mean getting money into your PayPal. There\u2019s a countdown timer and everything letting you know exactly when your last cash out was and when you can send money to your PayPal again. I\u2019ve got screenshots if you\u2019d like to see them. Just because you don\u2019t agree, doesn\u2019t make a true claim a misrepresentation. Non hourly tasks pay out ever 3 days, hourly tasks pay out every 7 days.

I'd assume if their game plan was to get people to do free work, refusing willing workers would be detrimental.  \n\n\nIn my personal experience, they're far above something like Appen, who pay like shit and treat their workers like disposable tools, they kicked me to the curb peak covid for no apparent reason.  In comparison, Data Annotation has been really good to me, so far anyways.  \n\n\nCrossing my fingers that it stays that way.",

After I have separated facts from opinions I can point to the facts and use them to put together a reasonable argument to sway an opinion without being insulting, 98% of the time anyway.

No guarantees of future work.\n\n4. Honestly, I think the work would become grinding if you were doing it full-time. It's kind of fun when you are dashing out maybe an hour or two in the evenings and see an extra $300-600 come in per week, but if you had to sit there for 8 hours each day doing the same sorts of tasks over and over again, it would get very old. I already find myself getting excited when a decent paying non-coding task pops up into my queue for a change of pace.\n\nThat being said, if I were look at something like FIRE and could get there quicker by patching in 5-10 hours a week of Data Annotations on top of my retirement funds, that would be much more tempting.",

It's a lot more involved than that usually, and I'm also qualified for the programming tasks, so the projects I usually work on are much more specific in focus, but that's basically the majority of the work on the platform, or some variation of that.\n\nAs for them doing anything fishy, no.  I've been working for them close to a full year and not once have they ever done anything fishy.  More often than not, when I see complaints about the platform, it's because they didn't pass the assessment, and in a lot of cases, it's super obvious why.  But people will just call the site a scam when they aren't accepted, which doesn't even make any sense, if they were trying to scam people into providing free work, it wouldn't be so hard to get in to begin with.\n\nIn the case of this thread in particular, it sounds very much like OP's friends were likely inflating their hours hoping for a quick, easy payout instead of actually doing the work, because there's 0 chance they made $6000 without ever making a withdrawal.  That's like 2 months of work minimum with the starting projects if you're working reasonable hours, or maybe 3-4 months if you're doing it on the side, without requesting a payout when the platform allows withdrawals every 3 days (I personally withdraw every weekend).  Nothing about the story adds up.  Of course they're going to remove people that are trying to fleece them.\n\nAdditionally, they are extremely anal about quality writing and people having the ability to remain objective in the face of strongly opinionated topics, such as politics.  If someone can't differentiate between personal feelings or opinions and facts, they won't pass the assessment.  On a similar note, if someone can't display some aptitude for researching information or fact checking, they would also be rejected.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI don't know what my official role would be called, I basically train AI to provide more helpful answers.  I primarily work on the programming projects.  \nNo, the site is not fishy or a scam.  Been working for them for almost a year and have always been paid on time for all of the work I've done.  Yes, I'm still working for them.",

The measure of a man is not how he treats his equals, but his treatment of those he considers lesser.  If you want to know if someone is a good person (companies are also a person I guess, thanks citizens United) see how they treat retail workers, serving staff, or people they don't want anything from like the reject pile of their HR department.",

After submitting some initial information, I received a Coding Qualification and was brought on board the very next day.\n\nCurrently, I'm earning $40/hr just for training various AI models. As my entry was based solely on the coding assessment, all of my projects involve coding, which explains the higher pay compared to what many on Reddit report.\n\nI've encountered no issues with project execution or payment processes. Now, in my third week, administrators frequently contact me with offers for projects that have even better pay rates. It\u2019s an ideal work-from-home opportunity\u2014if you possess the necessary skills, I highly recommend applying.\n\nAdmittedly, my English is far from perfect\u2014probably on par with most discussions in this thread.

Every discussion board and subreddit for DA is FULL of stories of people being \u201cremoved for no reason\u201d when they\u2019re usually misreporting time, using other AI to answer prompts or just straight up not following instructions on projects. \n\nWith all this in mind, it\u2019s absolutely mind blowing that someone would leave $6k in their account knowing they could wake up and it could be gone.

I\u2019m not sure how this makes sense when one of the tests is showing up as \u201ctransferable.\u201d\n\nLike many others have stated, my skills supposedly align with exactly what they\u2019re looking for. I teach high school language arts and have been doing this type of work on Mturk since 2018 with a 99.9% approval rating. I realize that none of this guarantees me a thing, but I\u2019ll get to that in a second. I\u2019m guessing that they liked my writing skills initially, because I got the qualification tests only hours after taking the initial assessment. They also see that I have the proper coding skills since I got the full bonus, yet there\u2019s no work available for me and I haven\u2019t officially been paid.\n\nAgain, I realize that writing skills and similar experience with micro tasking isn\u2019t a guarantee, but I applied after a few of my colleagues and none of us have heard back. As of right now, about a dozen of us have applied and it\u2019s the same story: no one has heard back. We all have different skill sets and backgrounds, yet not a single one of us made the cut? Maybe they don\u2019t need people from our area? Maybe they don\u2019t need any more teachers? I truly don\u2019t know and I\u2019m just speculating here.\n\nThey could be backlogged, they could be having technical difficulties, or they could be a total scam. There are a lot of people on this platform who talk them up, but there seems to be an equal number of people who say they\u2019re a scam company.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I\u2019ve been getting a lot of spam emails since I signed up and one of my coworkers has been getting spam texts. He was actually able to \u201cwithdraw\u201d the payment for his qualifications, but it isn\u2019t in his PayPal account yet, so I have no idea if he\u2019ll ever be paid.\n\nSomething that he and I both find peculiar\u2014the reviews for this company on social media are either glowing or they say it\u2019s a complete scam. There is no middle ground and this strikes me as a bit odd because there is always some sort of complaint about Mturk and Prolific on their subs; not a bunch of people talking them up or calling them scam companies. Mturk has gone downhill lately, but this wasn\u2019t the case when they were offering a ton of work either.\n\nThis all makes it truly difficult to determine what exactly is going on with this company. I saw a comment on this thread saying that the only people getting paid are the ones who promote this company all over social media. Maybe they\u2019re on to something!",

Not clearly communicating to people whether they passed or failed the initial qualifications\n2. Kicking people off the platform without warning (even people who have worked for them for a long time)\n\nAs for why the reviews are either terrible or glowing, it's probably because it's pretty much a dream job until they suddenly cut ties with you. Well, that and the fact that people give it 1-star reviews just because they didn't pass the strict qualification test (which is kinda silly).\n\nI feel bad for OP's friends, but there's also no reason to worry about losing *that* much money seeing as how your earnings become transferrable after 7 days. Also, from what I've heard, even if you do get fired, the earnings are still transferrable unless you did something dishonest (e.g. used ChatGPT to do some of the work for you).\n\nRegarding you and your colleagues not getting in, my guess would be they don't currently need any more people. The platform can definitely just be full sometimes - there was a gap of a year between me signing up and getting invited to do the qualification test lol",

I have a medical assistant certification and haven't been able to work in a clinical setting for two years now because I was diagnosed with Vestibular Migraines - basically a debilitating disability that causes vertigo at any point in time regardless of how long I've had vestibular therapy. I'm bound to working from home, but go figure - finding a remote position that's in the medical field is extremely rough when my hearing is being affected by this disability and all the positions require a heavy amount of inbound/outbound phone calls.\n\nI don't have the mental capacity to do anything else after work (daily tasks) and my two teens are in middle/high school so they already have things on their plate so contributing with chores is just that - contribution. So I don't have everything done by the end of the day until the weekend. By that time, trash and dishes are piled up and so is the cat litter and it's so overwhelming that I don't have time to use the weekend to recharge from social exhaustion.\n\nI thought that Data Annotation would be the *perfect out* from all of this until I can go through all of my Coursera classes for anything to get out of the medical field but holy heckin heck why is my luck so dull.",

Don't assume that everyone has your skills, they just do not! Even those skills you think are just normal might be pure gold to the tech behind the scenes.\n\nSo, let me spill the beans about me\u2014I've been coding since dinosaurs roamed the internet, from Fortran and Basic to Python and React. Tech skills? Check. But guess what? I'm also a science fiction writer. Yep, I sprinkle that creative magic on my writing. Now, I don't brag about it, its just a hobby, hell I released my last novel, that took me a year to write, under the Apache 2 GPL License. But not everyone can whip up a creative storm. It took me a decade to work out other people weren't 'just pretending' not to be able to write creatively, they really can't, who knew? Well seemingly everyone but me knew. \n\nSo, don't hold back on your skills! Let the AI in on the whole deal, from your everyday talents to the unique stuff.",

It stopped saying \"thanks for taking the assessment, we'll email you\" and just said \"sorry, no work\". No email was ever sent to me, and the support button on their own site stopped working for my account. Like they literally disabled the support form without any notice or apparent reason.\n\nI reached out for help with a post on their subreddit, but it was swiftly deleted by the moderators despite violating none of the rules. My friend (who does get work through them) says he thinks the mods are employees. So they do have the time to shut down criticism but not enough time to respond to any questions whatsoever.\n\nOf course, they have enough of a labor pool where they don't have to care whatsoever about alienating or hurting anyone and can afford to be as arbitrary as they want in banning people and then never communicating.

And to those currently working there and loving life- just be careful because it WILL happen to you too, it\u2019s just a matter of when. I was loving life too at one point, read a bunch of negative reviews like this one I\u2019m writing and didn\u2019t believe it until it happened to me\u2026 everyone has said the exact same thing too. Fired for no reason, tons of money in their accounts that they never saw again. No one will even contact us back about the money in our accounts that they illegally decided to keep for themselves.\u00a0\n\nI wrote in to my local job board last week and I know they will get my money back. Just BEWARE this company!! I don\u2019t want to see this happen to anyone else. Or at least enjoy it while you can- and don\u2019t quit your day job. It\u2019s great for side money, but it\u2019s unreliable and only a matter of time before you\u2019re robbed.\u00a0\n\nSorry for the long answer! I\u2019m still super salty over it :(\u00a0\n\n*** side note to those wondering why we accumulated so much without cashing out***: you get paid every 3 days for pay per task tasks. Not hourly tasks. Those pay once a week. So if you work 3 hours on a Monday, you can cash out for JUST those 3 hours the following Monday, but then have to wait a full 3 extra days before you can cash out anything again. So THATS why we accumulated so much and lost it all. Because it\u2019s complicated. Some people have bills and need both Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday\u2019s wages to pay those bills. So we\u2019d have to wait until Wednesday to cash it out or risk cashing out SOME money and having to wait 3-4 days to get the rest. Only cash out once every 3 days and get paid for hourly tasks you did 7 days ago. If you worked there, you\u2019d understand. It\u2019s not as simple as it may seem.",

And it sounds like you accumulated the same amount over the same time period with a similar outcome. Other than that, I can't think of how else I violated the code of conduct. I never mis-reported hours. and I feel confident in the quality of my work.  \n  \nOnly side note- I did submit 2-3 tasks after they were expired over the course of the last 3 weeks. I was super apprehensive about doing that, but I had put a lot of effort into them each time this happened and just wasn't watching the clock close enough, so I submitted it anyway assuming if it was that much of a problem they just wouldn't pay me for it. I am curious now if that was a contributing factor. Seems like they could just send a warning to be like \"stop doing that\" rather than terminate someone, but this is the only reason I can think of besides putting in too many hours.",

How it works is you put $100 (bitcoin) into what they call a work account. This money is used to optimize products for merchants. The work is fast and simple. You make $50 in pay and $40 in commission a day, then you get that and your $100 backs at the end of the day. Here is the clincher. They have a \"Random\" bonus system. If during your 3 sets of tasks (40 each) you hit a bundle you get 15-100% the regular commission. I got one during training. I think I got an extra $8. 1st day went smooth but the person training confused me more than helped me. 2nd day I hit another bundle. Here's the part they don't for-warn you about. Now to continue to finish and get my money I have to put another $85 in. So, I cough it up, Finish the set, I get my $90\u00a0 plus $185 deposit and my extra $60. WhooHoo, right? Wrong! This is the scam. Next day, same thing except this time they need $475 more. Now, I'm on disability so I don't have that kind of money at my disposal. So I I use my rent. Start back up again BOOM! Another bundle, 1st task. What are the Random chances of that, right? Guess what? This time I have to pay $1471 to continue so I can get my new found fortune (haha) and my $575 back. I don't have that much money. No one mentioned this in \"training\" So, I'm out, I cant finish, I don't get paid my $90, my $575, MY money i put in or my 2 (15-100%) bonuses. I get nothing and now I can't pay rent due the next day. If I did have the money I probably wouldn't have done it any way $50 says once I started up again I'd get another bonus and this time it could be $4000. Fool me twice...Right!? So think about it before you work for them it's a scam from the get go. I have documented everything. If you want to see it or have questions, hit me back in the comments on this review. STAY AWAY, PLEASE. Leave the job to the little rich kids who can afford to have Daddys Money taken away. You can read their users guide but it doesn't mention paying more money to get your money back. If you ask they give vague answers and show you sweet innocent pictures of the person training you.(another lie)",

Reached out to support twice with no response, once two weeks after the wipe and once a month after. \nIn summary, you can make good money but expect to be dropped with no explanation at some point.
