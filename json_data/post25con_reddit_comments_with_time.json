So a small bias turns into a massive one. \n\nIt's also kind of a black box, there's not a straightforward way of understanding how it reaches its conclusion.\n\nAnd as such, it's a great way for people to avoid responsibility because it was based on \"AI\". You don't need to provide criteria because it's \"AI\".",

AI tools have already perpetuated\u00a0[housing discrimination](https://archive.curbed.com/2019/12/17/21026311/mortgage-apartment-housing-algorithm-discrimination), such as in tenant selection and mortgage qualifications, as well as hiring and financial lending discrimination. We can expect it to do the same thing in the labor market. It was even leaked that Israel is using an AI to create kill lists and track when militants return to their homes to launch targeted strikes to kill their families/children.\n\n2, because AI is being used as a labor-saving technology, which will impoverish workers by eliminating entire sectors of employment.\n\nThe only way to address this would be to seize ownership of AI platforms from private companies and billionaires, socialize it as a public good, and administer it democratically in the public interest.\n\nAdditionally policies that increase the bargaining power of workers, especially marginalized workers like women, including higher mandated wages, union and job protections, and a guaranteed basic income, will help blunt the impact of AI on the labor market.",

They tested this with the words \"boy\" and \"girl\".\n\n[This was the result.](https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1675551031/mirroredImages/aPeJE8bSo6rAFoLqg/anudaiz53rq5ps7u1ob3.png)\n\nCurrent chatbots solve problems like this by putting up artificial guardrails to prevent it from discussing certain things. (\\*edit: I accidentally imply here that these are the only things they do, see u/Raileyx's reply to me) The issue is that the training data is the foundation of the AI and if we start getting AI that makes meaningful decisions, those decisions will be based on its understanding of the world which come from its training data. Putting up guardrails does not solve the problem.\n\nAlignment is one of the hardest challenges we face right now, it is the problem of making the AI want what we want. Your example about hiring for a computer programming position is an example of an alignment problem, making it want to hire the best candidate is a different problem than making it want to hire the candidate who is most like the candidates currently being hired. Even if we had a theoretically perfect unbiased AI we would still not know how to tell it to hire the most qualified candidates without solving the alignment problem, which is a philosophical problem as much as a computer science problem.\n\nThe problem I'm talking about is more fundamental, because we do not have a perfectly unbiased AI to give instructions to. How you can even make an AI in the first place without encoding biases in the most basic level if all of your training data talks about boys and girls differently? Even with perfect instructions, the AI fundamentally views the world in a biased way and acts on its biases, and all we can currently do about it is try to imagine all the ways it could be sexist and put up guardrails asking it not to do those things.",

I don't fully understand the implications of this, I doubt anyone does, and what I'm suggesting is just my own theory on very preliminary research outside of my area of expertise. Science communicators have their work cut out for them, maybe we could make a bot to do it.\n\nI'm unsure what any of the results of that semantic mapping study say about how the model will behave, but we can still see standard gendered biases when we run tests like \"write me a poem about \\[male name\\]/write me a poem about \\[girl name\\]\", [and the results are unsurprisingly favored towards courage for men, beauty/mystery/wisdom for women.](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/grY9uSDoLBuen9py4/petertodd-s-last-stand-the-final-days-of-open-gpt-3-research#Return_to_the___petertodd__deflections) These tests were done on an old model and I would love to see this become a standard test for LLMs if it isn't already. Cursory research shows that current LLMs still have similar problems if not this exact one. If some startup wants to make an AI tutor or something to help your kids with their math homework, [boys and girls will get different answers to \"what can I be when I grow up\"](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.00277v1), and I don't think the general public really understands this enough to deter a startup from trying something like that.\n\nI don't claim to be an expert and I don't keep up with the industry trends or anything, but I am fascinated by the research and I know some good places to point people.

I took kind of a similar view on it, in that this is mainly academic, how important this is for LLM behavior when you're not doing crazy things like creating a custom vector that's the average vector and asking the model to tell you what that embedding means.\n\nI thought about what all this might imply, but ultimately just agree with the top-comment under the article\n> \n> *My guess is that humans tend to use a lot of vague euphemisms when talking about sex and genitalia. In a lot of contexts, \"Are they doing it?\" would refer to sex, because humans often prefer to keep some level of plausible deniability. Which leaves some belief that vagueness implies sexual content.* \n\nBasically saying that that the centroid \"ghost token\" as he calls it would have some sexual definitions.. since it's the most vague vector by nature of being THE mean vector. I'm not sure if that's actually what is happening though. It sounds plausible to me, but this is might already beyond what human intuition can grasp, so I'm not sure how much this interpretation is worth.\n\nIt's possible that there is no good human explanation for what is happening, and that the researcher just went way too abstract and is just getting lost in patterns that don't exist - god knows at this point, like we're plotting an n-dimensional embedding space in places that are totally off the beaten path. Ghost-tokens. Looking at something that the AI itself can't directly access until you program it to.\n\nSo far so good, the second part of the post is what's really disturbing, but to me it gets even more theoretical there - the researcher was sampling random spots close to the centroid and stumbled upon a weird one (the virgin stuff), then sampled close that that one and found REALLY weird things. And ... I don't really know what to make of it. \n\nI don't know what it means. The researcher doesn't know what it means. Nobody on lesswrong knows what it means. One of the comments says\n\n> *I am not convinced by the second part of this, because you looked at a lot of points and then chose one that seemed interesting to you.*\n\nand that's.. also kinda true? He did look at a lot of points, chose one that can go wrong in a lot of ways, and then it did go wrong in a lot of ways. Does this mean anything?\n\nAt the end of the day I understand, on a human level, being unsettled by the holes showing up so consistently near the centroid. It is just flat out weird, and to quote the article again:\n\n> *In the context of these predominantly negative themes, the recurring mention of \"making holes\" or references to holes can be uncomfortably interpreted in a sexualized manner, especially given the overall focus on female sexuality.*\n\nBut I'm just not convinced it actually means anything. I guess it's important to point out that you'll never be in these parts of the embedding space when you just use the model natively. Most of the embedding space is just an empty void after all - beyond interpretability. There probably isn't a single token anywhere NEAR the centroid. It is incredibly esoteric research. \n\n\n> It shows that the language model has come to understand that the word \"girl\" should often follow the word \"slut\", \"sexy\", \"pussy\", or \"orgasm\". I don't see how this would be any better than these words being embedded closely together.\n\nSee, I don't really agree with that. It think the only thing it decisively shows is that when you want to maximize the probability of \"girl\", the preceding gibberish will contain these words more frequently than other words. I agree it's not a good look, no question there, but in terms of actual interpretation of what this means or what the AI has learned? I just don't know.\n\nBut thanks for linking it, it's super fascinating stuff!",

Unfortunately AI itself is not in its infancy and can still do harm, so I am hoping we can get more attention towards this kind of thing.\n\n>My guess is that humans tend to use a lot of vague euphemisms when talking about sex and genitalia.\n\nThis makes sense given how highly \"penis\" is placed above the other sexual outputs, but then why are most of these other sexual outputs there? Do we frequently refer to \"a woman who has had a baby\" or \"a woman of child-bearing age\" vaguely? I don't know. The more I see weird sexual things like this the more suspicious I am of a much simpler explanation, which is that we are training these models on an unthinkable amount of data scraped from the internet, some of which for sure is sexual, and many words and concepts expressed in those places will be unique to those places and we don't know where the model will group those things conceptually. Maybe the centroid is where vague things go, but those vague responses seem to happen in any out of distribution part of the space. The sexual things seem to be specific to the centroid.\n\nUsing gradient descent on an image generator to find the image with the highest probability of being a fish will produce nonsense, but it will produce nonsense which has the impression of fins, scales, and gills.\n\nUsing gradient descent on a language model to find the tokens with the highest probability in ending in \"girl\" produces a nonsense sentence, but that nonsense frequently includes the word slut. I think its reasonable to assume for now that it is telling us something about what it has learned.\n\nThat's enough for me to say \"hang on, what the fuck is happening here, be careful how you use this.\" I think spot fixing issues like that until the toxic output stops and moving on without fully understanding the implications is a recipe for finding out the implications later, but competition without regulation is fostering this culture of spotfixing.\n\n>At the end of the day I understand, on a human level, being unsettled by the holes showing up so consistently near the centroid.\u00a0\n\nSmall correction, those samples were at distance five. The significance as the author says in a comment is:\n\n>The point of including that example is that I've run hundreds of these experiments on random embeddings at various distances-from-centroid, and I've seen the \"holes\" thing appearing, everywhere, in small numbers, leading to the reasonable question \"what's up with all these holes?\". The unprecedented concentration of them near\u00a0*that particular*\u00a0random embedding, and the intertwining themes of female sexual degradation led me to consider the possibility that it was related to the prominence of sexual/procreative themes in the definition tree for the centroid.\n\nSo having initially had an impression that the hole thing was sexual in nature, we find sex near the centroid, holes being uniquely ubiquitous, and holes being concentrated in this neighborhood that seems to specifically have to do with the degredation of women. Again, I'm a human and I'm designed to see patterns, but that doesn't smell right. Its not exactly scientific proof, but for a technology that is advancing this fast and already on the market in a lot of different applications, I think these kinds of things are worrying.\n\nAlso its worth mentioning since some people were downvoting you that none of what we're talking about here is about whether or not these LLMs have a gender bias in the first place, which I think is something we both agree on. Its just about how deeply encoded those biases are.",

Take their history, take their language, take their values, interests, and principles and superimpose your history; your language; your values, interest, and principles on them. And no matter what conclusion they come to in the challenge they face, they will always act in the interest of the oppressor.\n\nAI is a tool being created by the privileged for the patriarchal capitalist owners in our society. It is being used to address what they value, it's language (the data) is what they understand of the world, and it's using their version of history. AI, as it exists, will entrench status quo or exacerbate existing bias \u2014 for it will deviate from reality in the same ways we currently do. \n\nIt will show sex and race-based differences that at best be used to better understand something and at worse be used as if they are inherent differences. Is women being paid less than men a research project or will AI use it to lowball offers to women by only offering them jobs as maids instead of janitors? \n\nWorse than simple recreation of oppression, AI (along with the rest of tech) are becoming monolithic gate-keeps in society. Never before could nations truly enforce and track their borders and citizens as they do now. Never before could anyone manufacture the consent of the masses within days. And with it, as never before have, it can create barriers to organizing or even becoming a successful entrepreneur.

We'll soon be in a position in which even efficient regulation won't be able to keep up with advancements and even if that wasn't the case, we're unable to intervene in the wealthy's private projects anyways.\n\nHow could we if we could intervene, though?

If you don't respect that distinction, there's no point in trying to engage with you. \n\nAI is trained with a certain subset of history, using certain metrics, to do something \"of value\" \u2014 all of that defaults to working for oppression. Whether that AI is really just the \"I\" of a person or not, unless each and every aspect is reviewed (what data is being chosen, how it's being represented/defined, and what it's being used for), the only outcome will be entrenching oppression. \n\nWhy? \n\nBecause for such an injustice as oppression to continue, it requires a cognitive dissonance only possible through misleading history and reframing how we think to avoid confronting injustice while conflating values with excuses necessary to defend it. \n\nIt's how MLK and Suffragettes are told to \"just be patient\", how we get respectability politics, how we got told slavery was \"morally acceptable\" while ignoring indignation of the enslaved. Undoing that is work, but it's how we have the language, values, and history feminism, anti-racism, and socialism teach us. It's how we can qualify injustice as just that and giving us the tools to address it and the cognitive dissonance of the status quo. It's why feminism has roots both in the streets with direct action and in academia. \n\nWithout proactively and explicitly addressing this bias of the history (subset of data) and language (metrics) used to create AI, it will have that bias. But the value driving its creation to begin with, the value that might ignore the issues with systemic bias or not, is what will determine systemic bias is even a concern. That value is private profit (for the financial security to survive or affluence to thrive). \n\nPrivate profit, though, will and has exploited systemic oppression for its own ends. It's entrenched it further with enumerable examples. Since most people at least partially empathize with poverty, an easy example is bank loans, which can get away with offering the marginalized (who have fewer opportunities and vulnerable to being exploited) worse loans which, comparatively, further restricts their future opportunities. It's why tech and optimization lead to more productivity and generation of wealth while its the capitalists, not the labor, who reap the most benefits. \n\nAI, similarly, is a tool of the elite for the ultra-elite and will be used myopically and greedily for private profit \u2014 and we know private profit motivates all sorts of horrors and corruption. And like philanthropy, any efforts to use AI \"for good\" will be at best a bandaid over a self-made wound rather than a true attempt to fix the cause of these issues (for philanthropy is done from within oppression: from the history of being a patron of the unfortunate, the language of generosity instead of addressing that it's pennies on the dollar gained from exploitation, and the value of maintaining the system as it is). \n\nI could underline and address other parts of my comment but I feel I've given you enough effort explaining another's quote and why it's relevant. But suffice it to say, ChatGPT didn't even allude to anything radical when I asked it your question. \n\nBut feel free to condescend that I think \"magic\" is how AI will benefit capitalists and ignore what I have to say. For \"magic\" is a convenient explanation for what we don't understand or care to explain. And \"magic\" is as good an explanation as any other for those who won't listen to understand.",

Systemic bias is bias of (human) systems on a societal level. Statistical bias speaks to issues with statistical methods and data. Though you can use statistical methods to try to measure aspects of systemic bias (i.e. what you referenced or the gender pay gap). Distinct doesn't mean \"entirely different\"\n\nI truly don't care to quibble about pedantic points, but distinct doesn't mean \"entirely different\" but \"different in a meaningful way\" and I would appreciate if you took the time to pause and figure out what I mean, or ask, rather than presuming my poor communication means I'm wrong in some way.\n\nLastly, and most importantly, it's non-trivial (and likely unimportant for maximizing private profit, which could instead exploit it) to truly fix how systemic bias ingrains itself in data. I'll redirect future engagement with me to instead focus on [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction) or [Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Women:_Exposing_Data_Bias_in_a_World_Designed_for_Men).\n\nEdit: I can't tell if OP just loves to hear himself talk (i.e. mansplain) or doesn't understand \u2014\u00a0to cut this exchange off here with an edit instead of a response, I'm not saying the corrupting effect of capitalism merely exists but that it's the primary reason we cannot stop AI from exacerbating (or becoming a part of) systemic bias.

The effect of class discrimination in our unfair system, disproportionately targets for example Black people in a systemic way.\n\nIt's a given that in a capitalist system, people with money who own technology will seek ways to use it to increase their competitive advantage and that that will probably also algorithmically increase inequality. If ultimately that's all you meant, your point was valid.\n\n*Most feminists seem to agree with Kendi's terminology. While I don't like this terminology as an individual, I am not denying the fact that in a world with economic inequality by race, class discrimination can disproportionately impact those underrepresented races. Kendi's terminology exists for the reason that Kendi ultimately wants to fix the gap. He doesn't want to for example only help rich Black people while disproportionately keeping the segment of the African-American population that was poor because of past racism poor based on class discrimination today",

The creation can be better than the creator, if it is specialised to be or has some kind of inherent advantage. \n\nLet's see if gpt4 would've understood the point I was making. Here's the output:\n\n\n\"*Person A argues that AI can be less biased than humans if it is given the correct directions or programming.\nPerson B counters by pointing out that the directives for AI come from humans, who are inherently biased, implying that this human bias can seep into how AI operates.\nPerson A then uses an analogy involving a calculator to make a point. They suggest that even if a human who is poor at arithmetic programs a calculator, the calculator itself will still perform arithmetic correctly, not inheriting the programmer\u2019s weakness in math.*\n\n*The purpose of this calculator analogy is to illustrate that tools or systems can be designed to perform tasks with a high degree of accuracy and objectivity, regardless of the personal abilities or biases of those who create them. In this case, a calculator, once correctly programmed, follows strict arithmetic rules and thus, operates correctly regardless of the programmer's personal skill in arithmetic.*\"\n\nwhoa!

ChatGPT isn't an algorithmic AI, it's a machine learning algorithm, and as such, it does a great job of reproducing text typical of what you'd find in an internet argument.  And because you described the argument from your perspective into ChatGPT, you biased it to your perspective, so it's reproducing a typical internet argument of a person who is seeing things from your perspective.\n\nWhat happened here is that you missed Kali's central point in your description of your argument to ChatGPT.\n\nYou said that if given the right directives, it wouldn't be biased.  Kali said that biased humans would give it the wrong directives.  Since you missed this central point of her argument in describing the argument to ChatGPT, it agreed with your interpretation that Kali wasn't understanding your analogy, hence reproducing your bias.\n\nMy extension of your analogy is that the only reason a programmer who is bad at math can produce a calculator that is not bad at math is because there already exist functions in all programming languages for simple mathematical operations, that were programmed by programmers who are *good at math*.  So any person who is bad at math can just write println(num1 + num2); and the computer will do the math for them.  The tools need to be created by *someone who understands math* to tell the computer the right thing to do.  There don't exist algorithmic tools for \"tell me if this person is qualified for the job\" or \"create an image of a doctor\" that were written by a person with no biases, the way there exists algorithmic tools for addition and subtraction that were written by a person who is good at math.",

That's why I picked that analogy, because it's something that computers are clearly better at than us. If you were gpt4, you would've understood.\n\nAs for bias, human brains are exceptional at producing bias due to how vital tribal identity and group belonging are to our survival and social organization. We're basically made for it. I'm giving AI a decent chance at being less biased than us, which again, I don't think is a large achievement. Humans are terrible at this.\n\n>What happened here is that you missed Kali's central point in your description of your argument to ChatGPT.\n\nKali's point was: \"Bad human make AI. Therefore AI bad too.\" I've seen the point a million times before, it's not exactly hard to understand. I took it for what it was - a general statement on the expected performance of the system, given the shortcomings of its creator. Also, I already qualified my beginning statement with an IF, clearly showing that I'm aware that AI can be insanely biased if it's programmed to be. But if it isn't, meaning, if you give it a general directive of \"just be helpful\", and give it general training data that encompasses most of everything (as is done, nowadays), it WILL be less biased than the vast majority of humans.\n\nNow you can pretend that I didn't understand what she was saying (I did), but I'm one step to feed your post to gpt4 as well, and we both know how that's gonna go. \n\n  \nIf anything, this exchange here proves exceedingly well that humans are fucking crap at understanding each other due to their biases - whether you think I'm the incapable one or not, clearly there's a breakdown in communication. Long story short, humans fucking suck at this, always have, always will. If it comes to being unbiased, I'll trust an AI over a human ANY day of the week.",

Can you explain why that's wrong?\n\nChatGPT  Certainly! The idea that a biased programmer can create an unbiased artificial intelligence (AI) system oversimplifies the complexities of AI development and the nature of biases. Here\u2019s a breakdown of why this is generally not the case:\n\n1. **Bias in Data**: AI models, particularly those based on machine learning, learn from data. If the data used to train these models is biased, the AI will likely inherit and even amplify these biases. For example, if a dataset for a hiring AI contains historical hiring records that show a preference for a certain gender or ethnicity, the AI may replicate or intensify this bias in its decision-making processes.\n2. **Programmer\u2019s Influence**: Programmers make numerous decisions when designing and developing AI systems. These include selecting datasets, choosing which features of the data to consider, and determining how the model should evaluate its performance. Each of these decisions can introduce subtle biases. A programmer's own beliefs, experiences, and biases can influence these choices, even unconsciously.\n3. **Complexity of Identifying Bias**: Unlike the mathematical operations in a calculator, which are straightforward and well-defined, biases are often complex and multifaceted. Identifying and mitigating biases requires not only technical skills but also a deep understanding of social, cultural, and ethical contexts. Programmers may not always be aware of the biases embedded in the data or in their methodologies, making it difficult to create a truly unbiased AI.\n4. **Lack of Standards**: There is no universal standard or clear-cut methodology for eliminating biases in AI systems. The field of AI ethics is still developing, and while there are emerging guidelines and principles, applying these effectively in practical, real-world situations is challenging.\n5. **Feedback Loops**: AI systems often operate in feedback loops where they continuously learn from new data generated through their interactions with the world. Without careful monitoring and adjustment, an AI system can develop and reinforce biases over time, even if it was relatively unbiased at the outset.\n\nIn summary, creating an unbiased AI involves much more than just having the intention to do so; it requires concerted effort, rigorous methodologies for identifying and mitigating bias, and ongoing vigilance to ensure biases do not creep in as the system evolves. Just as a poor mathematician can program a calculator because the rules of arithmetic are precise and well-understood, biases in AI are not as easily defined or corrected, making the comparison with a calculator quite misleading.",

How is THAT a viable strategy? Look at this MAGA supporter over there, he thinks the earth is flat!\n\nIt actually understands language, you know? If it didn't, it wouldn't be able to do the things it does. Semantic embeddings are pretty amazing and inhumanly subtle, so to say that it has no grasp of anything and just acts as a statistical parrot is kind of crazy to me, but I understand we're now at a point where your own \"AI = bad/stupid\" bias kicks in too hard for this conversation to be productive. If it wasn't already doomed from the start.\n\nedit: u/oftenconfused1001 just responded and then blocked me so I can't respond to them anymore (nice move, very cool), but I still see the their comment and it's so ridiculously wrong that I'm just gonna write my reply here:\n\nModern LLMs (and also LLMs that are not so modern) use something called semantic embeddings, which is basically a learned mathematical represenation of tokens (which we'll just pretend are words for simplicity's sake) - they order these into an embedding space, where all the words are then arranged depending on how they relate to each other.\n\nI'm oversimplifying here, but if you have for example the embedding for the word \"blue\", it will, in some dimension, be similar to the word \"ocean\", and the word \"sky\". You can also do math with the embeddings, so for example when you have the word queen, and then add the embedding for daughter, you will get an embedding that's close to the word princess - it does this for ALL words and the result is pretty fucking solid and allows a grasp for how everything relates, on a far deeper level than humans could ever understand language. \n\nYou can read about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) and it's all really cool and fascinating, but the bottom line is: LLMs DO know what words mean, and they DO know what sentences mean, and they DO understand language. If they didn't, they couldn't do half of the cool shit that they can do.\n\nI think it's a fucking embarrassment that someone who claims to have written their thesis on machine learning would say something so obviously and demonstrably wrong. Like actually embarrassing. I'm half glad they blocked me, because I can not imagine someone like that having anything useful to say, just as a general rule. Being uneducated and clueless about how these things work is one thing, but having a RELATED DEGREE and still being clueless? Absolute shocker. Extremely embarrassing and (I don't use this word lightly) actually kind of pathetic and sad.",

Image-processing models follow a similar process, meaning that they internalize what gets shown the most.\n\nEven AI that isn't trained on literally the entire internet gets trained on the data available to the programmers. So, for example, cameras programmed by white people tell Asian users \"It looks like somebody blinked. Let's take that picture again.\" Because they've only ever seen white faces. Sinks programmed by white people don't activate when they detect a black hand. Because they've never seen black hands.\n\nNobody is trying to make racist or sexist software.
