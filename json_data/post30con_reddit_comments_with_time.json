About 30% of people with autism are nonverbal. The numbers overlap perfectly. They are indeed being discriminated against, but it's because they lack the necessary aptitude for employment.\n\nLiterally every job requires some level of communication.

It's not a shortcoming of DEI as a concept. There are employers who are hiring through specialized neurodiversity platforms, like neurodiversityjobs.co.uk, auticon.com, specialisterne.com etc.\n\nMany employers also have talent programs that explicitly cover neurodiversity, e.g.:\n\n* https://careers.microsoft.com/v2/global/en/neurodiversity.html\n* https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/careers/neurodiversity\n* https://www.pfizer.com/about/careers/disability-and-neurodiversity-hub\n\nThey usually provide interview processes that have been adjusted to better suit the needs of the candidate. Our company has definitely hired neurodiverse candidates through similar programs.",

You cannot expect to accommodate someone in a wheelchair if you are hiring a yoga instructor. It could be argued that nobody discriminates against those on the spectrum, because it isn't something you can see. It's something that is behavioral, and human interaction is a huge part in how the world operates. I happen to have ADHD, but it has never affected my ability to be hired, because I don't advertise it and I manage it by myself. Similarly, many people with high functioning autism have the ability to \"fake it\" and can pretend to be neurotypical to a good enough degree that it doesn't affect them during the hiring process. \n\nThe issue with unemployment among those on the spectrum is because they are typically judged by their speech and/or actions. If someone in a wheelchair interviews for a programming position, it is easier to instruct hiring managers to ignore their disability and only concentrate on their code. But human interaction is a huge part of almost any job, and hiring managers also evaluate a candidate based on their perceived ability to fit within the team. This automatically works against many neurodivergent people, and it could be argued that the bias against them is similar to a \"bias\" against disabled people when hiring yoga instructors.",

You have \"issues\" compared to the norms that could affect your work or aspects of your work. DEI does not necessarily have that. To accommodate DEI, all you have to do is establish **fairness and politeness**, at least in general. To accommodate neurodiversity though? You'd need different processes especially given how, well, diverse, the results of neurodiversity could be. Even something like dyslexia can vastly affect work process compared to like... being PoC. The PoC works, in theory, exactly the same as a white person. A neurodivergent does not (or at least does not always).",
