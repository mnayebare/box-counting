I\u2019ve decided that my ultimate goal in life is to be a shining example of a woman in STEM who is perfectly fine at my job\u2014And that\u2019s the end of it. Women are constantly being pushed to mentor, and lead teams, and sit on boards, and do outreach, ad infinitum.  But you better ALSO be some kind of technical wizard, otherwise men lose respect for you for not doing the real work. \n\nWhereas **nobody gives a shit** if a man just does his basic job everyday and never does any extras like committees, mentoring, etc. Nobody is disappointed that a man is merely competent and not some technical unicorn. \n\nCan I just do the part I like? (Ya know, the STEM?) And leave me alone otherwise?",

The best way to get into AI is to first learn everything you can: figure out how it works, know the use cases and where ai is headed. Then, start building things. Whatever you want. You dont even need to learn code if you arent a coder, just how to prompt. Take what you learn and approach your own workplace, linkedin, your network...this can lead to some great connections and opportunities. I was in the dot com era, we are in 2.0 of this now and the earlier you get in, the better. Maybe your own ideas will even turn into a business.",

When I heard men go over the ancient \"bigger is better\" theme in terms of AI my head just kind of explodes. There are so many natural qualities women trend into which would help AI it seems crazy they aren't making more decision about the AI models. \n\nWhen I reflect on my mother and father, My dad was all about ensuring we had good Quantity of life factors from money to driving force. However, my mom was major into the Quality of life factors, and still is. She was able to be a stay a home mom who was college educated with a \"English Major\" and believed her degree was going to be useless. Let me tell you, it wasn't. I got a broad education, in home tutor, and a respect for quality classic materials. Even now when my parents are in their 70's she's still driving the Quality of life factor from projects in the house they live in to keeping ties together in the family.   \n\nBig D\\*\\*\\* males who love to throw money at projects was great for AI getting out the door, but all children need  two parents and I don't think this one is any different, in fact I think this one needs both more than any other.",
