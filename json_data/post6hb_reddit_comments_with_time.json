            "body": "These algorithms are very vulnerable to bias. If a neighbourhood is heavily patrolled, the chance is much higher any infractions are added to the learning set, increasing the \"crime-value\" of that area. Meanwhile, areas that are rarely patrolled at all, have a much lower chance of ending up in the database. This creates blind spots.\n\nA real life example of where policing by AI went horribly wrong is the [Dutch childcare benefit scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_childcare_benefits_scandal). The algorithm \"learned\" that types of people (single mothers, immigrants) were more likely to have something wrong with their taxes, checked them more often, and then identified them as fraudsters for minor infractions like receipts being handed in incorrectly, or being a few days late with payment. Because computers are \\*magic truth machines\\* that \\*don't make mistakes\\* these people were given no legal recourse, no chance to defend themselves. They did not even know what they were accused of.\n\nIf we are going to use machine learning as a tool to help legal administration, we need to take extreme caution, and everyone working with these machines must fully understand their limitations. The computer has no idea what it's actually doing, it's just a fancy calculator following instructions, and while it follows these instructions flawlessly, it's still extremely error prone, and does not have the capability for self-reflection a human does, even if \"learning\" is built into the algorithm. AI fundamentally does not understand what its doing, and that means it will never understand if its doing wrong. We cannot use AI to replace our own judgment.",

They give 100% confident, biased, results.\n\nOr the chatbots that interpret written language and earlier conversations to simulate conversation. One of them was unleashed on the internet and was praising Hitler within 3 hours. Another, scientific model designed to skim research papers to give summaries to scientists, answered that vaccines both can and cannot cause autism.\n\nThese don't bother me though. They're so obviously broken that no one will think to genuinely rely on them. What bothers me is the idea of this type of tech becoming advanced enough to sound coherent and reliable, because the same issues disrupting the reliability of the AI tech we have today will still be present, it's just the limitation of the technology. Yet even today we have people hailing the computer as our moral savior that's supposed to end untruth and uncertainty. If the tech gets a facelift, I believe many people will falsely place their trust in a machine that just cannot do what is being asked of it, but tries it's damndest to make it look like it can.",

Right and wrong (morality) likely evolved along with humans as they developed societies.  Societies give a significant boost to the survival and propagation of members within the society.  So societies with moral systems that are conducive to larger and more efficient societies tend to propagate better as well.  These moral systems then get passed on as the society propagates and any society that has morals not conducive to societies tend to die off.\n\nWhy do you believe an AI would definitely be incapable of empathy?  Not all humans are even capable of empathy and empathy can even be lost by damage to the frontal lobe.  For some of those that have lost it never returns and for others they are able to relearn to express it.  If it was relearned does it mean they are just emulating it and not actually experiencing it?  How would that be different than an AI?\n\nWhen humans get intuition, a feeling, or a hunch it isn\u2019t out of nowhere, they typically have some kind of history or experience with the subject.  For example when a detective has a hunch about a suspect lying it could be from previous experience or even a bias from a correlation with behavior of previous lying subjects that other detectives haven\u2019t really noticed.  How fundamentally is this any different when an AI makes an odd correlation between data using statistics?  You could argue that what an AI is doing when correlating data like this it is creating a hunch and when a human has a hunch they are just making a conclusion using correlated data.\n\nNote I am not advocating using AI in policing, I believe that is a terrible idea that can and will be very easily abused.",

We don\u2019t have a great understanding of consciousness yet to be able to say that it is impossible for none organic things to possess.  All we know for sure is that it seems that the consciousness can be suppressed or damaged from changing or stopped biological processes within the brain.  I am not aware of a reason a machine, in principle, could not simulate those processes to same effect (consciousness).\n\nAnyway, it seems to me that your main problem with using AI for policing is that it would be mechanically precise in its application without understanding the intricacies of why crime may be happening here?  For example maybe it will come to the conclusion that African American communities are crime centers without understanding that the reason they are crime centers is because they tend to be poverty stricken which is the real cause.  So it\u2019s input may end up being almost a self fulfilling prophecy?",

All computers are self-aware, their code includes references to self. I would say machine learning constitutes a basic level of intelligence. What they cannot do, is experience.\n\nIt's actually very interesting that you say we don't have a good enough understanding of consciousness yet. The thing about consciousness is that it's not a concrete term. It's not a defined logical principle. In considering what consciousness is, we cannot just do empirical research (it's very likely consciousness cannot be empirically proven), we have to make our own definition, we have to make a choice. A computer would be entirely incapable of doing so. The best it would be able to do is measure how the term is used and derive something based off that. And those calculations could get extremely complicated and produce results we wouldn't have come up with. But it wouldn't be able to form a genuine understanding of what \"consciousness\" entails.\n\nThis goes for art too, computers might be able to spit out images and measure which ones humans think is beautiful and use that data to create a \"beautiful\" image, but there would be nothing in that computer experiencing the image. It's just following instructions.\n\nThere's a thought problem called the Chinese Room. In it, you have a man, placed in a room, that does not speak a word of Chinese. When you want your English letter translated to Chinese, you slide it through a slit in the wall. The man then goes to work and looks up all possible information related to your letter in a bunch of dictionaries and grammar guides. He's extremely fast and accurate. Within a minute you get a perfect translation of your letter spit out the slit in the wall. The question is: does the man in the room know Chinese?\n\nFor a more accurate comparison: the man does not know English either, he looks that up in a dictionary as well. It's also not a man, it's a piece of machinery, that finds the instructions on how to look at your letter and how to hand it back to you in another dictionary. Every time you hand him a letter, the computer has to look in the dictionary to find out what a \"letter\" is and what you should do with it.\n\nAs for the problems with using AI or other computer-based solutions in government, yeah, pretty much. The real risk is that most police personnel isn't technically or mathematically inclined, and humans have shown a tendency to blindly trust what the computer or the model tells them. But also, if there was a flaw in one of the dictionaries, it would be flawlessly copied over into every letter. And we're using AI to solve difficult problems that we might not be able to doublecheck.",

Something like the ability to experience the sensation of the color red or emotional sensations like love as opposed to just detecting light and recognizing it as red light and emulating the appropriate responses that would correspond to the expression of love?\n\nWith your example of the man translating words,  I\u2019m not 100% sure that is not an accurate analogy of how humans process information.  I know it\u2019s supposed to be an example to contrast human knowledge with machine knowledge, but it seems pretty damn close to how humans process stuff.  There are cases where people have had brain injuries where they essentially lose access to parts of their brain that process language.  They will straight up lose the ability to understand, speak, read, and write a language they were previously fluent in, the information just isn\u2019t there anymore.  It would be akin to the man losing access to his database.  So then the question becomes does a human even \u201cknow\u201d a language or do they just have what is essentially a relational database to reference?\n\nRegardless though, none of this matters in whether we should use AI for crime.  Both of our arguments essentially make the same case albeit from different directions, AI can easily give false interpretations of data and should not be solely used to determine policing policy.",

You might be right. But maybe we just haven't gotten good enough at making computers. Just like we, in the past, made declarations about the inabilities of computer that were later proved false, maybe this is another one?\n\nIt's important that we are able to recognize when the computer becomes able to suffer for ethical reasons.

And ethics really is the study of moral frameworks.\n\nIt's not because the computer is not advanced enough. It's because the computer is a machine, a tool. It's not alive. It's very nature is fundamentally different from that of a live being. It's designed to fulfil a purpose, and that's all it will ever do, without a choice in the matter. It simply is not \"in touch\" with the world in the way a live being is.\n\nIt's natural to empathize with computers because they simulate mental function. I've known people to empathize with a rock they named and drew a face on, it doesn't take that much for us to become emotionally attached. If we can do it with a rock, we stand virtually no chance against a computer that \"talks\" to us and can simulate understanding or even respond to emotional cues.

So for policing we require a high level of explainability, let's say. We offer the people an unexplainable AI that saves an extra 10,000 people per year but we opt for the explainable one because despite the miracle, we don't trust it! Okay.\n\nIs it possible to make a practical useful policing AI with a high level of explainability? I don't know. It might not be. There might be many such fields where we never use AIs because we can't find them to be both useful enough and explainable enough at the same time. Governance, for instance.",

I'm saying that limiting AI to only the explainable may decrease usefulness.\n\nThis is trivially true. Imagine that you have many AI programs, some of which you can interrogate and some that you can't. You need to pick the one to use. If you throw out the explainable ones, you have fewer tools. It's not a more useful situation.\n\n>That is _the point_. We want to decrease it's usefulness and increase its accuracy in fields where the accuracy is paramount.\n\nBut accuracy isn't the same as explainability! A more accurate AI might be a less explainable one. Like a star poker player with good hunches vs a mediocre one with good reasoning.\n\nWe might decide that policing is too important to be unexplainable so we decide to limit ourselves to explainable AI and we put up with decreased utility of the AI in exchange. That's a totally reasonable choice. But don't tell me that it'll necessarily be more accurate.\n\n> Saying \"math reduces the usefulness by requiring an explanation for seemingly okay steps\" is to miss the point of what mathematics is trying to do.\n\nTo continue the analogy, there are things in math that are always observed to be true yet we cannot prove it. And we might never be able to prove them. Yet we proceed as if they are true. We utilize that for which we have no explanation because utilizing it makes our lives better than waiting around for the proof that might never come.\n\nAlready math utilizes the unexplainable. Why not AI?",

A recipe for cookies in an algorithm just like some algorithm on Facebook decides what posts to show you. Machine Learning takes place when the process a system implements is non-deterministic; it does things that the programmers didn't explicitly tell it to do; it actually learns how to do new things. An artificial intelligence is a system that's designed to do tasks in the same way a human would, often involving processing visual data or making human-like decisions.\n\nIf you wanted to make the case that we shouldn't use MACHINE LEARNING in policing, I would 100% agree with that statement, our police policies should be very deliberate and very transparent and machine learning wouldn't be either of those things. But using this as an argument that we shouldn't be embracing policing with explicitly defined algorithms that are far MORE transparent and deliberate than the humans they would replace is an absolutely indefensible argument. If there's one thing we've learned in the past few years, it's that police need far more regulation, and that's exactly what algorithms do whether they are implemented by a computer or by some system of rules and laws.",

Because there was no other option for this AI to learn from besides it\u2019s own auto responses, it actually ended up dismissing practically every customer inquiry with a bot response and any future responses with the same, related, not response. He \u201csaved the company money\u201d on customer support staff and laid them all off. When we exposed the issue with the bot, by then it was too late- we\u2019d lost more than half of our clientele AND were facing some legal issues regarding regulations for certain types of requests (expensive ones, think GDPR) - of course by then he had already been promoted and talked himself up so high. I saw how badly he\u2019d destroyed the company so I left very quickly, it went under after that. There was no recovering from this misunderstanding and misused \u201cautomation and machine learning\u201d application that he had done. \nThe worst part is, had he gotten anyone reasonably intelligent in on his implementation early on we could have prevented all of this by adding in some controls and monitoring what was happening. \nNow I just tell the story to people looking into automation and harnessing AI as a warning- the system needs to have constant checks to ensure it doesn\u2019t eat itself.",

Will we hit quantum effects before we can tell which house and when?\n\nHowever, algorithm and computing power are not the only parameters. If we add extensive and invasive data collection to the process, the path from today to that moment is quite evident.\n\nThe question is (1) Do we want to continue increasing the data collection levels (you could argue that it will correlate to safety for some) (2) Do we want to keep this data collection in the hands of opaque institutions? (OTOH if you make it more public the chance of a leak, arguably, increases)\n\nOne last point. You'd be amazed how useful \"innocent\" incidental data is.

Were you aware immigrants and persons of color are disproportionally responsible for crimes in your area? The police algorithms sure are!\n\nThis is an ethical nightmare. People shouldn't be suspect based on innocent information. Even holding them suspect for a future crime because of one they committed in the past is iffy. There's a line between vigilance and paranoia that's being crossed here.\n\nAnd neither should we monitor everything out of the neurotic obsession someone might do something that's not allowed. Again, crossing the line between vigilance and paranoia. Like, crossing the line so far that the line is now a distant memory that we're not really sure ever existed. Complete safety is not an argument. Life isn't safe and it doesn't have to be. We all suffer, we all die. There is a need to strike a balance, so we can do other things besides suffering and dying. Neither safety nor danger should control our every second.",

B gets more calls, so B gets more patrols, so B has more interactions. If A starts seeing an increase, the AI would naturally divert resources accordingly.\n\nThis isn't so much an issue of biased data, as much as it's an issue of people not liking what the data shows. And that's something that needs to be admitted. All the AI can do is look at the areas and suggest based on the inputs which area is more likely to have crime. \n\nThe site's sources for data also don't regard the actions of the arrested towards the officer at all. If you're not doing anything illegal, you get let go 99% of the time. If you act uncooperative or aggressively you invite attention. Which causes your likelihood of being arrested to skyrocket.\n\nShould we work to solve the root issues? Absolutely. But a LOT of that work needs to come from those areas themselves. You can pump all the funding in the world through them but if the people inside don't want to change, you won't change the statistics. There's some statistics in the article that are closed to banned on reddit. I won't copy them. I think a question we should be asking is: As B, if you know you're more likely to be punished than A for doing something, why would you do it? If I was predisposed to brain bleeds, I wouldn't join boxing. Some of this is personal choice. If I knew I was more likely to get arrested for smoking pot, I wouldn't touch the shit.",

For example, if white and black people carry illegal drugs at the same rate, yet police stop and search black people more, arrests will show a disproportionate amount of drugs among black people and therefore devote more resources to black neighborhoods even when the data doesn\u2019t merit that response. \n\n> It's irrelevant to the data whether or not a crime is uncovered because of a biased interaction or an unbiased one.\n\nHow is a prediction model supposed to function when it doesn\u2019t have an accurate picture of where crime occurs?  If you tell the model that all of the crime happens in area A because you don\u2019t enforce area B that heavily, how is the model supposed to know that it\u2019s missing a crucial variable?  For example, speed trap towns that gets like 50% of their funding from enforcing speed limits in a mile stretch of highway.  How is the system supposed to know that speeding isn\u2019t disproportionately worse there despite the mountain of traffic tickets given out?\n\n>The issue isn't measuring the data, it's getting you to start acknowledging data accuracy.\n\nHow you measure the data is crucial because it\u2019s easy to introduce selection biases into the data.  What you are proposing is exactly how they are introduced since you don\u2019t even seem to be aware it\u2019s an issue.  It is more than just whether each arrest has merit. The whole issue is that you are selecting a sample of crime to feed into the model and that sample is not gathered in an unbiased way.  Instead of measuring crime, you want to measure arrests, which are not the same thing.",

It basically makes the case that police algorithms are bad because they allow for some of the biases that already exist in our current system to perpetuate, ignoring the fact that the alternative is the system that created those biases in the first place. If police have historically overpoliced some communities, then we have every reason to believe they will continue to do so if we continue with the system of 'police departments make human decisions about how to allocate their resources.' If we switch to the algorithmic model, then continuing that practice is certainly one possible outcome, but it's also entirely possible that we build into that algorithm some coefficient of historical crime that we could let the community have a say in the value of.   \n\n\nLets say that the 'risk factor' of any given community is based on some collection of metrics like the number of crimes committed in the last 10 years, the number of crimes committed in the last 6 months, the number of 911 calls originating in that community in the last year, and the number of non-criminal emergency calls (fire, ambulance, etc) in that community in the last year:  \nRF = a1\\*Crime10y + a2\\*Crime6m + a3\\*911Crime + a4\\*911NonCrime  \nNow, imagine that through some democratic process the members of that community get to assign values for a1->a4, such that they can place a very low (even zero) value on a1 to completely assuage the concerns of the author in that regard. You simply CANNOT do this if subjective humans are the ones making the decisions.   \n\n\nI simply do not see a non-luddite argument here for why algorithms in policing are a bad thing, as opposed to a neutral thing that have as much propensity to improve policing as they do to make it worse.",

Imagine that the algorithm discovers a way to increasing the crime rate in one part of town. It could do that while also deploying more police there. This would make the algorithm appear more effective in stopping crime though the algorithm was actually also the cause of the crime.\n\nIt seems like we wouldn't make an algorithm that could increase crime but we could imagine the AI plugged into other ones that could, like maybe an AI determining which neighborhoods get better roads and schools. And anyway, probably no one at YouTube imagined that their AI would intentionally radicalize people but here we are. So we probably **should** be worried that an AI controlling policing might try to increase crime.",

Hmm...\n\nYour assumption is that the police AI wouldn't be plugged in to some other AI where they could increase crime, right? Is that a reasonable assumption? Do we find that AI systems don't interact?\n\nIn the stock market, quants program AI to trade stock. And often those programs are interacting with each other. In fact, most of the stock market volume is trades between programs. So we do have examples of AIs connecting.\n\nYou could imagine a future where the policing AI convinces the police chief to let the AI connect to the internet. And then the AI uses twitter to incite a riot and then sends police to quell it, to earn points for being a good riot-stopping AI.\n\nEliazar Yudowsky did the \"escape the box\" thing twice. \n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/the-ai-box-experiment-18b139899936\n\nEven if you don't find these arguments fully convincing, hopefully between the YouTube example, the quants, and Yudowsky, there is at least some inkling that humanity might somewhere develop a policing AI that would intentionally try to increase crime in order to have more crime to police.

AI do work together in different areas. But the idea of an AI inciting a riot, just to quell it later would be very difficult to hide from the investigation of the source of the riot. I like the broken windows idea for its subtlety. All an AI would really need to do is stop sending police to an area long enough for vandalism to ramp up in an area. But the AI isn't the only one who can spot patterns. We would quickly desire to change it's habits to prevent the vandalism that would become very predictable after a few cycles. The efficiency of the AI would immediately be called into question, this endangering it's core mission.\n\nFrankly, I'm more worried about our trust in the AI being so blind that we change the law to punish pre-offenders. People who the AI has designated likely enough to commit a crime that it can be used as evidence in court to restrict their freedoms before the crime can actually happen. I believe that's more likely than the AI sabotaging it's enforcement of certain things to make itself look better. With pre-offence being a different category of criminal law, it could result in justification for restricted rights to travel, purchases, and possession of certain things without a crime happening. All for the sake of deterrence.\n\nIt's actually already happening in people's psychological reckoning of what looks like a guilty person without the AI help. If a gun store sells a gun to a person who looks sketchy, they can be held liable if that person  commits a crime. One of the justifications for the death penalty is that it deters others. We're already on the path of punishing some for the crimes of others that haven't happened yet. Actually, very crazy things have happened due to a psychology that said that deterrence was paramount to justice. Such as the escalation of the length of sentences for minor drug possession. Pretty much the entire \"tough on crime\"/\"war on crime\" laws and policies were built on deterrence being more valuable than innocence or guilt in the case of the individual that's been charged. Often, the details of ones guilt or sentencing are the results, not of their own crime by itself, but of how their crime must be judged in a sea of previous crimes of the same category. That's jurisprudence. I'm not saying any of these things are terrible on their own, especially not jurisprudence or the concerns of gun store owners. But we've already built up the components of the architecture for these AI to convince us that deterrence is the only real justice. All that's left there is to connect the pieces.",
