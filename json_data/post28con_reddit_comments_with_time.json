            "body": ">So first let's look at what happened so far, let's use the US as an example\n\nFrankly, every time I\u2019ve read about this \u201crise of the robots\u201d fear, I\u2019ve felt the urge to tear my hair out. Because there were always two huge, huge problems with the thesis. The first is that while it makes a great science fiction story, so far there just aren\u2019t any signs that it\u2019s happening. And the second problem is that if we really want to change our economy in all the ways we\u2019ve been hoping \u2014 reshoring manufacturing from China, securing supply chains, preventing inflationary bottlenecks, and so on \u2014 we\u2019re going to need quite a lot of automation.\u00a0\n\nFirst, we just aren\u2019t seeing it happen. If anything, reshoring manufacturing, securing supply chains, and preventing inflationary bottlenecks all *require* more automation. Second, if robots were replacing humans en masse, we\u2019d expect to see a massive productivity boom \u2014 like what happened when agriculture was mechanized a century ago. But total factor productivity growth, while improving since the early 2010s, still hasn\u2019t reached the levels of the late \u201890s and early 2000s.  \n(Source: San Francisco Fed)\n\nReal wages are now falling because of inflation, but for low-wage workers they\u2019re falling by a lot less, or even rising for some. And real wages rose strongly in the late 2010s. So I\u2019m just not seeing the robotic competition in the[ macro data.](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6f41aa3b-dfb8-4134-ad31-7d2e1ba4371d_684x500.png)\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the international evidence to consider. Industrial robots are just one part of automation, but they\u2019re easy to measure and count, and they\u2019re something people focus on a lot. And when it comes to industrial robots, the U.S. lags far behind [South Korea, Singapore, Japan, Germany, and Sweden](https://ifr.org/ifr-press-releases/news/robot-density-nearly-doubled-globally).\n\nNow, two things to note. First,\u00a0[none of these countries seems to have a significant unemployment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_employment_rate). Second, they all have\u00a0[higher percentages of their workforce employed in manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sector_composition_of_the_labor_force_by_country)\u00a0than the U.S. does.\n\nSo the countries that use lots more robots in manufacturing than Americans do are actually managing to\u00a0*put more human beings to work in manufacturing*.\n\nAccording to this [paper by Larry Mishel and Josh Bivens](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-zombie-robot-argument-lurches-on-there-is-no-evidence-that-automation-leads-to-joblessness-or-inequality/), they present a convincing rebuttal to your argument that industrial robots kill jobs and reduce wages in manufacturing. They found that the result only holds for a narrow category of industrial robots.\n\n(1/2)",

[Hirvonen, Stenhammar, and Tuhkuri](http://economics.mit.edu/files/22239)\u00a0(2022)\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is that robots tend to complement workers, not replace them. Companies that automate often expand, hire more humans, and increase productivity. That\u2019s the same pattern we\u2019ve seen in earlier waves of automation.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is that companies that use more robots hire more humans (and retain their existing humans) in jobs that complement the robots. That\u2019s exactly what we saw with previous waves of automation \u2014 people find new roles, robots increase their productivity, and they get paid more. Looking at the countries that use the most robots in their manufacturing industry, it seems likely that this virtuous cycle is happening even at the level of whole nations.\n\nThe mistake many make when predicting mass AI-driven unemployment is assuming a world of absolute capabilities. But our economy is built on constraints \u2014 time, compute, energy, specialization. Comparative advantage doesn\u2019t disappear just because AI exists. In fact, it becomes even more important.\n\nAI won\u2019t be an infinite productivity pool. It\u2019ll be a constrained, valuable resource \u2014 just like skilled labor once was. That means humans will still have work to do. Not because we\u2019re the best at it, but because we\u2019re often *good enough*, and AI will be deployed strategically where it adds the most value.\n\nEven in a world of AI supremacy, there\u2019s room for human prosperity. The two aren\u2019t contradictory \u2014 they\u2019re part of the same system of trade-offs and scarcity. The real challenge is not about being outcompeted, but about identifying and leaning into the comparative advantages we\u2019ll hold in a post-AI world \u2014 the jobs too emotionally nuanced, too socially complex, or too mundane to justify compute costs.\n\nThose niches might just be the next gold mines.\n\n(2/2)",

Figuring out how to get the food to point a to point B while it seem like a simple take is really not. The biggest cause of famine is war and political instability. Just about everyajro famine going on fall under one of those 2 causes. Take the Gaza food crisis for example, there is more than enough food waiting to feed the population there but aid is being blocked. Let's look at Hati where the gangs there have taken over and torn down the social systems and destroyed farms leaving many vulnerable to hunger. How do you fix that, you can try to negotiate with the gangs but that gives them legitmancy and there are hundreds of gangs you would have to dedicate untold resources to statify their demands so they would let food aid come in assuming they keep their word. You could go in and try to break the gangs and re establish order but this is much easier said than done and would take decades. Any way point of this rant is that while like everything this issue on paper can seem like just a money issue it's not, the issue is extremely complex and not something you can solve just by throwing money at.",

I think the capitalist class could just as well banish the masses into some ghettos where they may be thrown some crumbs but otherwise fend for themselves. And then the capitalist class will create businesses catered to the rich and the small number of high-level workers who still have some economic value.\n\nIt would probably mean that there would be a massive shift away from mass production and towards luxury products, like yachts and private jets, and luxury cars, and super expensive wines and caviar and what have you not.\n\nBut I don't think capitalism would collapse if the masses couldn't afford stuff anymore. The masses would simply be banished towards the outskirts and the rich will create new businesses targeted towards high-end consumers.",

There\u2019s a whole other part of the population that, if given the income to do so, will participate in the economy and make these business even more money.\n\nMore importantly, however, is the concept of new technologies making way for new jobs and careers.

However, for people to be able to demand something they need something to buy it with. The more wealth that the rich elite hoard the more they are hurting the very demand that keeps them rich. I think of an economy like a body and the flow and transaction of assets and money as blood traded between organs. The economy exists because assets and money change hands. It is what gives such things value. The more wealth and assets that a small number of people decide to hoard to increase personal value, the more proverbial blood they take out of circulation to the rest of the body. When eventually, the concentration of wealth and assets are concentrated so much in a few individuals, it will be at the detriment of the body and economy as a whole as no one else will have anything to consume with and thus the economy weakens and dies. I do not think the few rich elite at the top will be able to prop up a whole economy with just trading amongst themselves.",

I read through the whole OP, and it has a good point. \n\nBut, I think people like to underestimate the resiliency of human beings and the thousands of years of evolution driven to survive encoded into our DNA.\n\nI agree that, yes, some people might drop off, as they have always done. (I harken it back to studies showing certain behaviors being favorable to our thriving so the ones that don't evolve with this trait being less common or dying off.) \n\nBut, like you said, civilization will continue, given our planet can sustain us. \n\nI'm a believer of the bigger picture and I think it's poignant that our population as a whole is decreasing and at the same time, the demand for human labor in the future forecasts is also decreasing. Call me naive or optimistic, but I think this kind of aligning works well and it'll work out fine. I mean, change isn't ever easy. But, yes, thirty years ago, no one would've imagined someone making an incredible living making homemade videos from the comfort of their own home (i.e. content creators).\n\nI can't connect to AI generated art, music and movies truly in the way I do to those created by fellow human beings, and most people I know feel the same. Humans gravitate toward community and connection with each other - we are wired that way, from before birth, especially as it's essential to reproduction (i.e. the traits I was talking about earlier being encoded in our DNA). Those things will not just die out, as much as the self-appointed tech overlords want them to.",

Because after all not everyone has what it takes to be a software engineer or data scientist or whatever. \n\nBut what happens once AI becomes so advanced that it can reason and analyze things better than almost any human? At that point probably only the most intelligent, the most exceptional, and the most gifted people would be able to fill those new jobs that AI can't quite yet do. \n\nWhat do you do once AI and robots can do everything that a human with say an IQ of 120 can do?

They went from man's 2nd-best friend to a luxury toy for the rich. Because brute, un-thinking labor was fully replaced by machines, and those who couldn't learn new skills were cast aside and obsolete.\n\n  \nThe same happens to carrier pigeons... the \"winged rats\" across many cities are the descendents of animals that once served as mail carriers for many. They never found a new niche, and are left feral.\n\n  \nThis didn't happen to humans in the industrial revolution because humans have the ability to learn new skills, and we have the manual dexterity to do more than just \"pull heavy thing\" or \"carry this load.\" But the AI revolution is different because, well, we're trying to teach the machine to think. We're already seeing programs that generate music and draw art, and some of it's even passable. IBM's Watson assists with medical diagnoses. and on and on.\n\n  \n\"thinking\" has been mankind's big adaptive advantage for the history of our species. If the machines can do that for us... what role is there that you could create a job for, that you can't just program a machine to do? It's entirely conceivable that \"program the next machine\" becomes doable by machines in our lifetime. And we're pretty much down to making babies and philosophic navel gazing as unique skills after that.",

I doubt 100% of jobs will ever disappear, but a point where a major section of society cannot find labor worth their effort while operating within their ability to learn or adapt feels like it's approaching more and more.\n\nThat's not an argument for doing away with prigress, just a grim observation of how we have developed far faster than we have evolved.",

You're overestimating competition on price, for example, Amazon is by default inflating prices of products because sellers pay a fee of up to 15% depending on product category. Generally, competition isn't as one dimensional as \"the one who cuts costs the most wins, everyone else goes out of business\". In reality it's about cutting costs to increase profits, but other businesses might be perfectly fine with a profit margin of say 5% instead of 15%. \n\n Macro-economically, Amazon cutting all the jobs would mean that labor is being made available on the market which then other businesses or industries can use to grow and increase competitiveness. I encourage you to observe the macro reality here, because you'll see that labor and consumption cannot just be taken out of the equation. Capitalism can only function if eventually goods and services are being consumed. Somewhere there need to be household incomes generated for this to work, and those incomes need to be sufficient, because it's all in the end basic accounting, someone's income is someone else's expenses.

People costs are in fact costs that can be minimized, especially if a much cheaper alternative exists that can produce the same output.\n\nBusinesses are not fine with a margin of 5% when 15% is achievable, they would be able to keep working of course, but the incentive system that is built in our society does not operate that way, even assuming a market with 0 competition (which is a big if, although right now a lot o sectors are very close to being monopolies so there is that), if there is a 10% extra potential to be made some shareholder will demand for it to be realized.\n\nFrom their point of view it's better if someone else pays the wages that allow people to buy their products, not them, they won't hire new employees they don't really need just for the good of the economy as a whole.\n\nSociety works as long as that someone elses exists and has the money to compensate their savings tied to layoffs, be it due to AI, other forms of automation or just off-shoring.\n\nIn fact we are already seeing this happening in the west, the purchasing power of workers is declining, or its growth is slowing compared to productivity, depending on where you live, while public sector's debt keeps going up, since we need someone to foot the bill and keep comsumption levels afloat.\n\nThe prisoner dilemma we are all in produces a solution that is not optimal - companies fire workers and run out of people buying their products, while the best one (stuff is cheaper due to automation and we are all richer for it) is only achievable if we all cooperate or change the rules of the game enough that we get there.",

You're implying this yourself, there needs to be mitigation. If companies just lay off people to use AI, they crash the economy, hence they saw off the branch they are sitting on. They can then try to mitigate that for example by pushing a UBI paid by the state, so wages are not paid by companies, but you cannot stretch that endlessly either since tax income is tied to labor. In a market economy, you simply cannot play this game as you wish, just outsource costs all the way. It takes massive and complex political mitigation, which ultimately cannot be facilitated. You'd have to be fully authoritarian, which however reduces economic productivity and profitability. We already see that there is resistance forming against the massive wealth inequality,  you cannot push it much further and do \"business as usual\" especially when the goal is mass lay offs and \"fuck you, I don't care how you eat\", then \"eat the rich\" will turn from a meme into reality in no time.",

Since then income inequality has significantly increased. \n\nThis is where you lose me.  The \"middle class\" is a wholly invented construct.  It developed as a way to describe the people who were not rich but also not poor, but also not working class.  It's an inexact classification with little utility.\n\nIncome inequality has risen, yes, and the \"middle class\" has shrunk in the United States.  Worldwide, poverty has plummeted as well. As much of that is literally true, however, it's because the middle class are becoming the upper class in the United States and we're finally addressing third-world poverty.  Clearly, the rise in wealth inequality is not making any  of those things *worse*, so why are you bringing it up?\n\n> But so that bring me to my main point, which is that technological advancement will most likely relatively soon reach a critical threshold, which will cause most human labor to lose its value, not just low-level labor.  If we consider how much technology has progressed in just the last 10-20 years, if we consider how rapidly AI has progressed in just the last few years, then we can only dream about how hyper-advanced society will be in say 25 years of 50 years.\n\nThis argument crops up every single time a new technology hits the market.  In case you missed it, LLMs are *not good at what they do* in a lot of ways.  It's not on track to replace much of anything given how relatively stagnant the whole thing is.  Given the hallucinations and what have you, we're a ways from generative AI, and even that won't be ready for prime time on release.\n\nMicrosoft Excel didn't make accountants redundant.  ATMs didn't kill the bank worker.  The luddites have never been correct.\n\n> But once AI reaches a certain point, the capitalist class will have no more use for the vast majority of the human population, except for a tiny minority of exceptionally gifted, exceptionally intelligent and exceptionally motivated group of extremely high-level workers who AI and automation cannot yet replace.\n\nWe're all the capitalist class, friend.  Capitalism won.  The world has never been more prosperous, and its people more better off, than it has under capitalism - especially following the fall of the Soviet Union.  \n\nWe're all capitalists.  We have come to the understanding that markets are the best way to distribute goods, that supply is the primary economic driver, that economic freedom is as important as any other.\n\nThe *most likely* worse case scenario is that AI displaces a nontrivial number of jobs and the people it replaces do something else, just like they have every other time some seismic technological advancement occurred.  It's highly unlikely that this would occur, either.",

You would know this if you read the articles I actually posted\n\nI argued that: 1) For the bottom 50 income has actually  rose for the past 50 yrs and your own paper state this, as it says \"Households in the lower-income tier experienced a gain of 43%, from $20,000 in 1970 to $28,700 in 2018. (Incomes are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\" \n\n2) There's no point in that article that suggest that purchasing power decreased for the bottom 50, if anything the quote i highlighted before suggest the opposite happened.\n\n  \nThen you claimed that even if incomes have rosen, since inflation has gone up, adjusted income are lower and so is the purchasing power.\n\n>Yeah and during that same time period inflation has risen 87%. Meaning that people are worse off today relative to actual cost of goods than they were 50 years ago.\n\nWhich, again, make no sense since all the numbers in that article are inflation adjusted, i once again demanded the passage in the text that supports your claims and you quoted one that does not adress any of my objection because it talks about shares of people living within some income quintile.",

From 1970 to 2018, the median middle-class income increased from $58,100 to $86,600, a gain of 49%.10\u00a0This was considerably less than the 64% increase for upper-income households, whose median income increased from $126,100 in 1970 to $207,400 in 2018. Households in the lower-income tier experienced a gain of 43%, from $20,000 in 1970 to $28,700 in 2018. (Incomes are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\"\n\nOr how about this part in the same article?\n\n\"The growth in income in recent decades has tilted to upper-income households. At the same time, the\u00a0U.S. middle class, which once comprised the clear majority of Americans, is shrinking. Thus, a greater share of the nation\u2019s aggregate income is now going to upper-income households and the share going to middle- and lower-income households is falling.9\"\n\nThe share of *income* in a growing lower class was 9% in 2018... it was 10% in 1970. For middle class, it went from 62% to 43%. That's a 20% drop in share of *income*. Meaning how much money they bring in. And, oh look -- magically the upper class went from 30% share of income to nearly 50%. Wow.. I wonder how that happened? How did the upper class, which barey grew, end up with so much more income than everyone else?\n\nAs I said, capitalism is a very good mechanism of redistributing wealth to the top. And that's exactly what every piece of data shows. Even the best case scenarios you can come up with still show that the majority of wealth is being held by a small percent at the top. \n\nEven that growth you cited? The majority of that growth, as it states in that articles happened before 2000. Things have been even worse in terms of growth for middle and lower classes for the past 25 years. Wanna take a guess what happened in early 2000s? Massive deregulation... which crazy enough somehow caused wealth to redistribute upward even faster. Its almost like the more you remove checks and balances from a system that rewards greed.. the worse the system gets for everyone except those at the top.\n\nAlmost exactly to a t the exact point I made to start. \n\nSince you haven't been able to back up a single claim of yours except to misread and even leave out parts of quotes from *my* sources... I can see you have zero intention of having a real discussion. I mean, I could see that earlier but after you started misquoting my sources while still avoiding posting a single one of yours, I had to come back to embarrass you one more time. \n\nHave fun convincing yourself that breaking your back to make money for the rich is good for you and everyone else.",

So, I am sure this is wasted effort. Nonetheless, since I actually genuinely care about the topic, I will give it a bit of a go.\n\nFirst, you seem to have confused my broader argument and a single source I used. At no point did I say this specific article proves everything I am saying. \n\nIt shows one part of the broader picture. While it spent a paragraph or two on quintiles, most of it doesn't even focus on that -- other studies do. So any argument made by either of us regarding quintiles didn't come from this article. I talked specifically about share of income and purchasing power when talking about this article. \n\nSecond, \"relatively\" flat means flat in relation to something else. Compared to those at the top, incomes and wealth for those in lower classes (compared to upper classes) has either risen far more slowly, not at all, or even in some ways gone down (depending on what measure you are using-- and there are multiple ways of measuring wealth, purchasing power, etc. -- even inflation) Additionally, even in measure where we see some growth,  growth for those in lower brackets has also decreased over time -- while accelerating for those at the top. In other words, as I've said countless times -- capitalism always leads to redistributing wealth upwards to a few. And there is not a single piece of data you could provide that would prove that claim wrong. Though, if you have some secret solid source that does, please give it to me. If I'm wrong, I want to learn what is right. (Also, I have a pretty good guess you either misunderstood the word \"relatively\" or are playing word games because I noticed you very specifically got rid of that word when 'rephrasing' me.)\n\nThird, having a smaller percentage of total income (and wealth more broadly) does mean that demographic has less purchasing power. Both in absolute terms (i.e. cost of good, housing and other basics rising out of sync with income), but also in that if you believe in free market capitalism where consumer choice is the balancing force against greedy corporations -- if a demographic has a much smaller portion of wealth, then they also have less \"voting\" power with their dollars. \n\nIf you disagree, my guess is you don't even believe in the tenets of free market capitalism you pretend you're arguing for.\n\nFourth, this was my original comment on this thread. \n\n/>Middle class mostly becoming upper class is false. We are seeing a larger and larger percentage of the US population (anyway) with a smaller percentage of total wealth. \n\nI have from the beginning been arguing that those middle class and lower has been growing in terms number/% of people and that the relative wealth of the middle class and lower has been getting smaller over time. Or, another way to put that is that wealth has been redistributed upward to a smaller percentage of people.  I never changed this position. I never moved the goalposts. \n\nBut, if you want to feel like you won a \"debate\" and that's what you need to feel good about yourself -- go for it. We live in a messed world, in a messed up time -- if that what makes you happy, then enjoy your sense of victory. It really doesn't affect me either way.",

Now you clearly understand that what you said was a bunch of bullshit that your own article  dismiss so you're trying to twist your words to avoid admitting you were wrong ( nothing wrong with being wrong).  But you were. Let's review your claim:\n\n\u201cSo, income growth in the US for the bottom half has remained relatively flat for the past 40-50 years, despite inflation. The buying power of the lower 50% has actually decreased. You would know this if you read the articles I actually posted.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah and during that same time period inflation has risen 87%. Meaning that people are worse off today relative to actual cost of goods than they were 50 years ago.\nSo, I was actually being generous when I called it flat.\u201d\n\nAgain, citing the articles you keep referring to:\n\n\u201cWith periodic interruptions due to business cycle peaks and troughs, the incomes of American households overall have trended up since 1970\u2026In 2018, the median income of U.S. households stood at $74,600.5\u00a0This was 49% higher than its level in 1970, when the median income was $50,200.6\u00a0(Incomes are expressed in 2018 dollars.)\u201d\n\nand then\n\n\u201cBut middle-class incomes have not grown at the rate of upper-tier incomes. From 1970 to 2018, the median middle-class income increased from $58,100 to $86,600, a gain of 49%.\u201d\n\nBoth this quote directly disprove your original claim that bottom 50 income growth has been relatively flat, and saying:\n\n\"relatively flat means flat in relation to something else. Compared to those at the top (and depending on how you're measuring it), incomes and wealth for those in lower classes (compared to upper classes) has either risen far more slowly, not at all, or even in some ways gone done\u201d\n\nmake no sense, you didn specify relative to what, so relatively here means \"quite\" and we've already established that bottom 50 income have not remained  \"quite flat\". \n\nNow even if what you meant was \"relatively to  the upper 50\", the phrase still make no sense, since it hasn't any meaning, it's not a mathematical statement not a meaningful description of the trends. \nYou could have said that one grow slower than the other, and I would have agreed since it's clear, but you didn't, you clearly meant to say that income in the bottom 50 didn't grow in the last 50 years. \n\n\nAbout the \"loss of purchasing power\" there are 2 things to be said:\n\n1) Purchasing power refers to the quantity of goods you can buy with a unit of the currency, and in fact the purchasing power of the dollar has been going down since forever, but that applies to every entity that use the dollar, doesn't matter if it's in the top 0,001% or in the bottom 99%, so you clearly was not referring to that measure. \n\n2) What you probably meant was that people now can afford less than they could in the 70s, you said it cleary here:\n\n\u201cYeah and during that same time period inflation has risen 87%. Meaning that people are worse off today relative to actual cost of goods than they were 50 years ago.\u201d\n\n Well this does't even need a proper response it's simply false , the pewresearch paper states multiple times that all incomes are measure in 2018 dollars, which means they are alredy adjusted for inflation. And if your line of reasoning were correct, and the article were showing nominal income, you would have undermined your own argument, since inflation also increased more than the income of the top 50%.\n\n\u201cFirst, you seem to have confused my broader argument and a single source I used. At no point did I say this specific article proves everything I am saying.\u201d\n\nI didn't confuse anything you made specifc claims and i responded to them, i kept citing the Pewresearch articole because the other one doesn't talk about income.\n\n\u201cI have from the beginning been arguing that those middle class and lower has been growing in terms number/% of people and that the relative wealth of the middle class and lower has been getting smaller over time. I never changed this position. I never moved the goalposts.\u201d\n\nYes you have beacause i challenged some statements you made, arguing you got the article wrong and you kept insisting that you were right, so don't try to twist this.\n\n\n\u201cBut, if you want to feel like you won a \"debate\" and that's what you need to feel good about yourself -- go for it. We live in a messed world, in a messed up time -- if that what makes you happy, then enjoy your sense of victory. It really doesn't affect me either way.\u201d\n\nYep showing moral superiority does really suits you, usually people with no arguments tend to use this strategy.\n\nSorry for how i cited stuff but it wouldn\u2019t let me comment from my pc and that\u2019s the best i could do",

The answer is there is none, it is arbitrary and subject to wildly different values per person. There'd be no formula you could utilize to determine the value of such contributions. Teaching someone how to write a poem doesn't have an objective value to society. \n\nAnd saying that artists shouldn't be able to create art as a profession is a massive downgrade for society. You're saying that all the actors, authors, writers, painters, poets, VFX artists, and performers shouldn't be rewarded for their work because there's no \"objective value\" to society. So rather than being able to create art professionally, they'd only be able to do it on the side in addition to whatever \"valuable\" job they'd now be forced into. \n\nIn capitalism, every worker who isn't literally in chattel slavery works for a wage that they agree to. An artist can live off of their work when others pay to purchase or view it. A professor can be paid to teach others ideas that may no have objective value to society, but which the students and university find value. And a therapist can work to help someone work through childhood trauma even though doing so will create nothing for society. They can do those things because of a market where people can choose to spend their own money on things they want to buy and others can accept it based on what they provide.\n\nIt's perfectly emblematic of socialism in general that you first describe it as \"the inherent worth for an equal share of society\" and then two comments later it devolves to \"artists, professors, and therapists shouldn't be able to live off of their jobs if it doesn't have objective value to society\".",

I was able to negotiate a salary above what they initially proposed, and it wasn't a CEO position. So yes, people can negotiate wages and people can control what they are paid just as much as their employer can control what they pay.\n\n>in reality in our society economic decisions are also made collectively, they're just made by the market.  a market over which nobody has any control\n\nA market where individual actors can make their own decisions and no one group has total control is exactly what makes capitalism so fantastic. Everyone who believes in human dignity would prefer that compared to an autocratic society where the government controls all labor pay with an iron fist.\n\nAnd I think this is where socialists truly fail to understand others: the average person doesn't want their existence determined by a centralized state authority, and if it was then society would be decidedly worse. There's a reason capitalist nations far exceeded those with centralized, planned economies. Central authorities suck at resource allocation for an entire economy and suck at economic adaptation.

We rely on the advancement of capital both for our own livelihoods, but for the world around us to operate.  \n\nThe people who tell you they are not part of the capitalist class just haven't realized it yet.\n\n> \"economic freedom\" is nothing more than the \"freedom\" given to capitalists to rape the planet and dominate the rest of us\n\nAh, yes, the fact that I have the ability, if I so choose, to open my own business, work for myself, etc., it's all to serve those evil capitalists trying to actually dominate me.\n\nIf \"we'll largely leave you alone\" is domination, then thank you sir, can I have another?",

            "body": "I'd like to touch on the subject of automation. I don't have a lot to say about AI replacing jobs, though if the brain-dead products we see foisted on consumers these days are any indication, I can't say I'm terribly concerned about that either.\n\nI worked as a machinist for about 15 years. I've worked in the medical industry, aviation, and general job shops. I've run CNC and manual mills, lathes, worked with injection molding, run wire and sinker EDM, and done a bit of welding here and there.\n\nAnd I can tell you from first hand experience that (a) the vast majority of people out there have absolutely no idea what \"manufacturing\" really means, and (b) there is no way you could automate *everything* with our current level of technology.\n\nRegarding (a), I think I've met, maybe, a handful of people who actually *know* what a machinist does. A lot of people think I mean \"mechanic\" when I tell them my profession. Just about 99% of the people I've interacted with simply have no idea how the things they use are made. None whatsoever. There is a huge portion of the population out there whose experience with \"manufacturing\" is little more than pushing a button on Amazon and having some shit show up on their porch two days later.\n\nI'm not saying this to bash on them, but to make the point that *how can someone say manufacturing jobs are at risk when they don't even know* what *manufacturing jobs* are? I dunno, maybe you do know, but I'm willing to bet you probably have never set foot in a machine shop or spent time trying to build something to a specification. It's a lot of fucking work. There is a huge amount of labor and problem-solving that is obfuscated by modern supply chains.\n\nThis leads me to (b), and the sheer amount of problem solving involved with even simple parts on a clapped-out Bridgeport can be really intense. Humans are used for a lot of manual labor not just because we have a useful body form, but also because (most of us) are capable of problem solving. It is absolutely *hilarious* to me when someone tells me a robot will take my job. Really? A robot is going to program a part in CAD, trouble shoot all the issues that come up, select appropriate tooling based on past experience, load that tooling into the tool holders, touch off all the tools and load their offsets into the tool length registry, set up the fixturing, load the raw material into the machine, dry run the program, watch the first tool with a hand (claw?) on the e-stop, monitor the program, and then make changes to the program/tooling/setup in response to out-of-tolerance parts or a machine crash? And do all that in less time than a trained human? What happens when something unexpected happens? How is your robot going to react?\n\nFor even something as small as a piece of aluminum that fits in your hand, there are a *lot* of steps involved to make sure you get the correct part at the end of the process. There is a huge amount of problem solving *and* fine motor control that has to be executed correctly in order to get what you want.\n\nNow, obviously, there are robots that can do these things. It is absolutely true that there are machine shops that run \"lights out,\" that have the process finely honed to the point where human intervention is not needed. It's also true that there are robotic assembly lines to manufacture cars (for example). But it's important to remember that processes like that are (1) incredibly difficult/expensive to set up, (2) takes up a *huge* amount of space, and (3) is incredibly limited in what it can do. Most of those robotic assembly lines make a half dozen cars. That's it. Those lights out machine shops are a little more flexible, but the capital investment into setting all that up is *insane*. Millions of dollars for the hardware alone, nevermind the glacial set up process. Those sorts of shops are generally going to be concerned with incredibly high-volume parts orders. While there are robots that can do these things, there are *none* that can do *all* these things in a single package.\n\nThe point here is human beings are still the most cost effective solution for a huge variety of problems. I think a lot of us take for granted how versatile human beings are, and we forget that we effortlessly do so many things that are fiendishly difficult to replicate artificially. Just look at how long and how much money it's taken to make robots that *walk* (looking at you, Boston Dynamics). Now add lifting and carrying things. Now add squeezing into weird spaces or picking up something that's fallen into the bottom of the machine. Now add using tools. Now add observing the progress of a machine and trusting your gut that it will complete successfully, or intervening if it won't. Now add listening to the sound of the machine and realizing it needs to have the feed rate increased, or the spindle speed altered. Now add inspection. Now add talking to the engineers, most of whom don't even know what a mill is. Now add machine maintenance. Now add putting raw stock away while your machine runs. Now add learning how to use a new machine in the shop. Now add sweeping the floors. Now add... so on and so forth.\n\ntl;dr: until someone invents a robot that can *perfectly* mimic every single action a human can do, humans will always be the most cost effective solution for a huge variety of jobs.",

It's not enough to simply develop a successful robotic human hand, then you have to successfully integrate it with every other system in your robot.\n\nAnd when robots that can mimic humans come out, they're going to be *so fucking expensive* that it will *still* be cheaper to just hire a human and train them.\n\nI would think the point at which robots completely replace humans is probably hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years away.\n\nThat said, when I left my last job, they were talking about how Fusion 360 now had a feature where it would automatically generate toolpaths for a given part. I can see that really being a time saver. I could spit out a couple of programs, and then a human operator could review them and select one based on how successful it will probably be. Though that *still* requires the human to know enough about toolpaths and machining to be able to identify potential errors.",

We'd see a bodycount that'll dwarf Oklahoma City, 9/11, and all the mass shootings from the last 25+ years combined.\n\nAs such...\n\nThose aforementioned jobs I mentioned will be safe in the coming dark age of brutal. prolonged technological unemployment. Those occupations will be one of the few sectors of the economy where it's workers can still thrive while mass joblessness jumps toward double or triple digits.

Insurance companies will absolutely require mandatory 24/7 security presence for most if not all establishments. Future polices will have those requirements baked into every contract. \n\nIn conclusion.\n\nThe workers employed in those aforementioned professions will be the last of the middle-class. I strongly advise anyone reading this to jump into those positions now. Before it gets crowded out. \n\nThe New Machine Age is at hand. Unfortunately... There won't be a place for everyone in it.",

I will give you that.\n\nAI and robotics can enter just about any industry, but there are always limits.  We can use them to build a greenhouse, and instead of human pickers use automated ones, sure. The human element is still better, decisions, not algorithms.  Besides the fact, robots don't exactly fix themselves, the need power, etc.\n\nPeople becoming economically obsolete? There is no economy without people.  People buy stuff, robots can sell stuff, but they don't purchase stuff; they don't generate stuff, they manage stuff. And I'll give you corporate wants the most efficient way of doing it to line their pockets.  I see it in both places I work.  One I work alone, I'm doing the job of three people over 8 hours, there isn't a robot who can fill a propane tank or count out change, or deal with the random issues that happen (like a brewing fight that cops have to get involved in). \n\nIs there a split between the 'rich' and the 'poor', and the 'poor' are growing? Yes.  Multiple points in history will back you up here (Russia is a great one, so is France, and we all know how that turned out.-- both pre-industrial periods).  Is it because of technological advancements, AI, or offshoring of jobs? No. \n\nOff-shoring of jobs? The US made it prohibitively expensive to stay.  Customer service is a big one. When was the last time you called your cell phone provider? Did you get a US rep?  Most likely not until you hit the higher levels, and good luck getting there. (I was one of many here in the US, we heard it for years 'thank god you speak actual English).  \n\nPeople are not economically obsolete, because without people, the rest is obsolete.  Markets don't work if there are no people investing, etc. Trade doesn't happen if no people need/want things.",

            "body": "To understand why collective ownership is both wrong and doomed to fail, you first need to understand what an economy truly is - a measure of output extraction.\n\nVirtually all economic systems start as agrarian; the wealth of a place is determined by the productive capacity of the land. Rich countries were fertile, poor countries were not. Wars were primarily fought to secure more farmland, or slaves to work those farms. Other resources were valuable, yes, but as you cannot eat gold it was deemed of lesser value than bread. In fact, *because* it was of lesser value, gold became a trade commodity; something you used to represent bread.\n\nWhen industrialisation kicked off, so too did our idea of value broaden, yet ultimately, value was based on land, and wealth was always about what you could pull out of it. As we evolved into capitalism, our measure of value shifted from the land to the worker; value is now based on how much work, or the quality of work, a person can do. Everyone who is remotely literate in economics agrees the labour of a brain surgeon is worth more than a teenager stacking shelves at the supermarket, because the former is something only a small number of people can do safely, while virtually everyone can do the latter.\n\nWe are increasingly rendering many jobs obsolete, replacing them with automation, and thus removing labour from the equation. But this does not mean it's time to wave red flags and abandon all reason. Instead, it's time to once again redefine where value comes from.\n\nIf you are astute, you'll have noticed the repeating pattern of \"value = scarcity\". What then is scarce when machines do all the work? Energy. Processing power. Runtime. There are bottlenecks even in a post-scarcity society; any process, even the operating of a Star Trek style replicator, will by necessity require power and generate waste, even if that waste is only heat. Heat is, in fact, likely the biggest limiter - the world would get pretty damn hot if everyone is running a sixty gigawatt per hour fusion reactor to power their personal holodeck. The planet would cook, and it's actually pretty difficult to vent heat out into space. Thus, a post scarcity society is simply creating a different kind of scarcity - the question we must ask is what is that scarcity going to be tomorrow?\n\nI think \"energy credits\" are the next step in our future. Think crypto, but regulated. The dollar becomes a reflection of the US energy output directly, and thus what you buy is not the product, but the energy required to produce and deliver it.\n\nThis model will require a rethink of how things are done. But this is true of any major shift in economics; perhaps the new system will involve some level of UBI, where money is created by distributing it to the people, rather than the banks. But it won't be socialism, any more than agrarian feudal states were socialist. It simply won't be capitalist.",

            "body": "An interesting argument can be had about the assumptions inherent in your opening paragraph:\n\n>So on one hand I'm not actually a communist or even a full-on socialist. But I believe that in the long-term parts of the economy have to be brought under collective control.   \n\n\nFundamental to Conservative thought labels any, ANY collective control over any part of the economy as socialism. It is a bogus and inflammatory line that has become implicit in most American thought on the subject.\n\nHowever examining the history of what actually works, for an economy, for a society, for an empire, strongly suggests that intelligent management of the economy is essential to the sustainability of that economy and of the society it supports. Your observation that people were better off when Liberals were running the country, more widely prosperous before wealthy Conservatives got back into power and began diverting most of the rewards of a booming economy into their own pockets, is entirely sound. \n\nThe reason Conservatives (Big C; people who control the narrative) oppose this is not ideological but opportunistic. It's that a system with fewer rules is easier to game and fewer protections for participants in that system means they are easier to exploit. Their objective is to maximize their own short-term gain, sustainability be damned. \n\n>Otherwise, if that doesn't happen it will eventually lead to a scenario where most people will become economically obsolote, and where the vast majority of people will be part of an underclass at the whim of those who own the means of production.\n\nAnd there you have another reason Conservatives oppose any government that is able to forge consensus about what an economy should accomplish and who it should benefit. Their entire objective is to create a system where we are all subject to the whims of the wealthy.  \n\nMy point being that a people coming together to manage the economy is not socialist. Reigning in the reckless, feckless greed of the wealthy isn't marxist. A well managed, well regulated capitalist society has been the most successful version of social organization ever attempted.",
