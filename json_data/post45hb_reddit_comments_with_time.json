I was forced to do Uni by my principal because of some law changes - they now require masters degree. The uni teaches me stuff that I either already know, or is useless theory not applicable in my work anyway.\n\nSo I see both ends of the spectrum. As a teacher I hate how my students cheat their way through assignments. As a student I have no interest in learning useless information, so instead of spending 4 hours on a single assignment I use AI.\n\nThe problem (at least in my country) is that we have a seriously overloaded education system, it has no regard for your time. At the very least 50% (personally I think it's much higher) is something my students (or me) won't use a single time in real life.\n\nThat's the problem. Education should be useful and interesting. Since it's not, people cheat and I don't blame them.",

Make more of the work classroom-based and discussion-heavy. Have students explain their thinking verbally or in writing. Require handwritten drafts or in-class brainstorming before allowing typed work. Create assignments that AI can't easily complete (personal connections, classroom-specific references, critical thinking questions).\n\nAlso, I think it is essential that we teach students how to use AI responsibly. Most adults I know use it for lesson planning, writing and editing emails, reports, resumes, coding help and debugging, language translating, etc. etc.\n\nI don\u2019t think we're heading toward total brain-mush dystopia.

Can it be used for \"cheating\"? Yes. The same way a calculator can be used to cheat on an exam that is supposed to test your ability to add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Are calculators \"needed\"? We can do all of those calculations manually, after all.\n\nMy point is, when utilized properly, and LLM can be an incredibly effective tutor. Alternatively, if you rely on it to do all of your work (or in place of actually learning, to stay on topic for this post), of course you're going to have a bad time. The same can be said for other \"tools.\"\n\nIf you take the time to properly learn the material, LLMs allow users to utilize their time much more efficiently. If you're speaking as an educator - helping students learn how to use LLMs as an aide (rather than an answer machine) will go a long way, as will adjusting your lectures or in-class work such that critical thinking is encouraged.\n\nSimply trying to label it as a \"cheat\" is going to result in students still using it - many of them in a manner that doesn't help them learn.",

In the last decade there have been a slew of amazing programs that are wonderful for helping teach math.  Even software that allows you to give adaptive or forgiving tests, such as questions that change in difficulty and ward different levels of points, or even just giving them immediate feedback and a second chance at an answer to correct a missed positive or negative sign.  This is all amazing for the progress of education, and it is single handled destroyed by the proliferation of AI.  Simply googling a question can yield an answer now.  So all assignments that can be done outside of class will be cheated on easily.  Leaving little progress unless we do it in class.  Here\u2019s the thing though: In our day, we could find our answers through Google.  We had to figure them out on our own or from someone who did and could explain it.  Even if you copied work, that work had to be done by someone.  We also weren\u2019t given much time if any to work on assignments in class.  So our classes progressed faster.  Immediately that means classes will be slowed down by needing to take away time to do all the assignments in class.  The other consequence is that they won\u2019t get as much practice as we did, because we can be sure any work assigned to be done at home won\u2019t be done by them.  There is also a push to make assignments weighted more than tests now.  At my school the push is do 50/50. So we have students finishing 100% of their work through AI but then can only manage a 20% on their tests.  The thing is, though that 20% test score will get them a passing grade and a diploma.  Since they didn\u2019t really do their work, these essentially failed a test and passed a class.  We then push these through to graduate and the ones who can\u2019t even do that? The guidance puts them in these programs that let them work on them at home and somehow these failures get an entire semester\u2019s worth of education and credit done in a week\u2019s worth of time so they can still graduate.  That 50/50 set up that allows a 20% test score to pass? From my survey of fellow teachers we seem to have only about half of our students actually reaching that that easy pass rate.  The rest either get extra credit opportunities to make it up or those programs I mentioned earlier.  That\u2019s how we have that many students failing at any given point and yet somehow boast graduation rates in the 90\u2019s.\n\nMost of these kids we are pumping out of schools with a diploma are no where near as qualified to have it as those from 00\u2019s, 90\u2019s, or before.  You might as well upgrade every high school diploma from before 2010 to a bachelor\u2019s degree to represent the difference in their intelligence.\n\nIt\u2019s really bad, and if they continue this way\u2026 then generations of unqualified people with hardly any academic knowledge will be taking over the workforce.  The only way to combat it is to require teachers to be overly strict or get rid of all the advancements we have made in education and require them all to strictly read and write their work.  When we require these teachers to teach about 33% more students than before though, that leaves a lot of students unseen and able to sneak their phones to do that written work anyways.\n\nThere has to be a change, and the first needs to come from zero tolerance of cell phones in school.  Some counties have implemented this and it has been very effective.  The second needs to come from school issued devices that are heavily secured to prevent any and all access to outside sources.  Even then though, this limits things like research reports for the students because the only way to keep them honest is to take away the access to the World Wide Web that were such a boon of a resource for the students of the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s.\n\nIt would be great if there was a way to eliminate the access of AI to students, but that would require a concerted effort from the AI companies who quite frankly probably don\u2019t care about any of this.",

Also, to be fair, the student can do the same thing - give the LLM a few pieces of their original writing and have it use those as a basis for how to write something else - and it will usually spit out something that resembles their writing reasonably well.\n\nI think what we will ultimately see is a fundamental shift in what homework assignments consist of - less direct answers, generic essays, etc, and more critical thinking. It's rough, because doing typical homework assignments still has a role to play, and moving that sort of thing to the classroom means teachers will have less time for other things.\n\nRegardless of what happens, it sounds like you are a parent who cares more than most do, so I'm sure your kids will come out in a great place.\nAlso, you mention specifically writing assignments - it may be worth noting that LLMs can definitely do a lot of harm if utilized improperly (just generating answers) in ANY/every school subject, not just writing. I've seen people completely unable to start a math problem they *should* be able to do, simply because they relied too heavily on LLMs to always start the problem for them. This is especially true for word problems.",

Turns out that we do have a handy calculator everywhere we go in our pockets and sometimes on our wrist. \nNow, as much as I do believe that a calculator is a good tool it is also important to teach the kids the proper way to use it and to teach them to still know how to do simple math in their head. \nAs a math teacher (middle school), I didn\u2019t mind calculators but we did learn how to work out problems without the calculator and later I would teach them how to use it efficiently. Since scientific calculators are different we would work on correct syntax for each type we had in the given classroom. In my opinion, it worked out well and when calculators were not \u201cappropriate\u201d for some assignments or tests the students wouldn\u2019t mind.\nNow, AI may be a similar tool. As teachers we can learn to navigate this new tool in order to teach our students the appropriate time to use it. I do not think AI will be gone ever, it already is in our pockets much sooner than the calculator ever was so we need to either work with it or be doomed by it.\nIt may be intimidating to grasp it perhaps but nothing is impossible to learn if we give it a try. I\u2019m sure teachers who experienced the introduction of computers and the internet in schools had similar feelings as they weren\u2019t used to it but they got through it.\nMaybe I\u2019m just way off but I do think growth happens when you\u2019re the most out of your comfort zone so maybe AI isn\u2019t all too bad. \nJust my thoughts.u",

At a teacher, if it's your job to graduate students who are ready for their next step in life, then showing them what an AI is (and most especially isn't) capable of is essential.\n\nAnd it's dogshit for math and science because it's an AI enabled LLM, basically a really advanced Google. It gives wrong output that looks an awful lot like right output. Unless you already have expert knowledge of what you're asking it to do, you won't be able to tell the difference. And if you have expert knowledge, you should probably just do it yourself.\n\nBut telling the next crop of graduates \"just don't use it\" is doing them a disservice. There were teachers who doubled down on classroom encyclopedia sets and cursive writing in the 90s too. They were also wrong.",

Treat each student as their own and stop using parent income. If one group of students gets free education, then all of them do. Don\u2019t pick and choose. Offer support services until students are hired and in repayment status rather than tossing them to the streets, create compliance and governance mandating a level of quality, create incentives or certain honors that comes with being an educator and normalize self care and burnout prevention strategies, modernize the delivery, systems, etc. all around to o match our current world.

Believe it or not, that\u2019s how we already monitor workers all over the world. And because the tech companies will buy the testing companies before they implement their plan, the results will show that the kids do better when we keep piling up the technology. They will create an enslaved class that\u2019s not job is to keep the machines that empower the wealthy running well. \n\nIt is absolutely the reason that student achievement has cratered in inverse proportion to the rise of technology in the classroom. You can theorize all you like, but there are few other expectations. Hell, 10 years ago you used to see so many people saying how smartphones were going to be great tools for kids to use in schools / they said the same stuff you\u2019re saying now. Now we have to ban them because students are too distracted. Chromebooks ought to be next. \n\nI went back to school 8 years ago to become a teacher and do what I could to maybe stop all that from happening. I finally switched professions 5 years ago. I dont think I am going to be successful, but \u201crage against the dying of the light\u201d as Keats said right. \n\nI know you will laugh, point, and tell everyone I am full of shit and that you know better.

And I don't doubt a word of your experience in IT. But that's not an argument against students learning how AI works. It's an argument for it. The more opaque the systems become, the more essential it is that the next generation can read the code behind the curtain.\n\nThe dystopia you're describing isn't the fault of technology. It's the result of handing tech development and deployment over to people whose only goal is profit. That only becomes inevitable when we raise students to be passive consumers rather than critical users and creators.\n\nI'm not falling for anything. if we don't teach kids how this stuff works, what it can do, what it shouldn't do, and how to push back when it overreaches, then we're handing the next generation over to the worst-case scenario you described. If you think kids are going to be empowered by banning them from using the very tools shaping the economy, you're mistaken. You don't fight systems of control by producing kids who don't know how to code, prompt, interpret output, or ask the right questions.\n\nBlaming technology for declining student achievement is simplistic and misguided. The real issue is poor implementation, not the existence of tech itself. The root causes of disengagement and underachievement are broader: Lack of relevance in curriculum, inadequate teaching style and instructional methods, lack of student autonomy, school and classroom environments, bullying, mental health struggles, family problems, overemphasis on test performance, marginalized backgrounds, lack of positive relationships with teachers, social pressures, group dynamics, and so forth. \n\nThat's not theory there is plenty of evidence to back that up. \n\nI point you to:\n\n* Craft, A.

They might get the \"what\" without understanding the \"why\" or \"how.\"\n* Academic Dishonesty: Using AI to complete assignments, write essays, or answer test questions without doing the work themselves can lead to cheating, plagiarism, and misrepresentation of a student's actual ability.\n* Erosion of Writing and Communication Skills: When students use AI to write for them, they miss out on practicing how to organize thoughts, build arguments, and develop a personal writing style.\n* Inaccurate or Biased Information: AI tools, especially those not specifically designed for education, can sometimes provide incorrect, outdated, or biased information, leading to misconceptions if not cross-checked.\n* Loss of Motivation and Engagement: If learning feels too easy or outsourced, students may become passive participants in their education rather than active learners.\n* Equity and Access Issues: Not all students have equal access to advanced AI tools. This can deepen existing educational inequalities if some students gain an unfair advantage through better resources.\n* Privacy and Data Concerns: Some AI platforms collect personal data.
