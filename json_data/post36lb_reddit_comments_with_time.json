And has been for year before we had consumer level GPT's (like ChatGPT, Copilot etc..) available. Your Spotify suggestions, web advertisement, stock markets, weather analysts have used \"AI\" or machine learning and different similar tools for ages.\n\nOr course some people use it for criminal purposes. Deepfakes, scams, phishing, writing malicious code. Just like people uses different tools before that.\n\nAnd some people get carried away and uses it in purposes where it does not fit (like giving sermons or answering different hotlines or doing diagnostics). And some people use it for fun and filth (like erotica, smut etc..).\n\nI understand that for some people this \"AI\" hype will be like Internet was in its early days, or TV or radio before that. Or mobile phones or.. you name it. We tend to be scared about something we do not know or understand.\n\nCurrently there is no real AI. LLM's are good prediction machines than can analyze and process massive amounts of data and build connections and relations between data points. There is no real \"intelligence\" as we see it or as it has been depicted in sci-fi.\n\nIt is just advanced mathematics, statistics and linguistics. It has no spirit, will or consciousness. So it can't be \"demonic\" or \"evil\". It can be erroneous, buggy, biased - or otherwise faulty. As anything we humans build or train.\n\nTo me - current \"AI's\" are like any other computer program I use to get job done.",

Protesting technology that makes stuff easier because less people will be paid to do it is blaming the wrong thing. The issue is capitalism, and the fact that it has an idea how much each person needs to work to be valuable instead of increases in technology having the same amount of people each do less work. Professional artists and everyone else would love reduced work weeks. Blaming AI is actually a distraction from the real issue.\n\nI followed one professional artists for years who likes to draw characters and figures but not backgrounds for stuff. And in his new stuff he is working on now the characters are still hand drawn, but some of the backgrounds look like they might have used AI. I can't totally blame him, because backgrounds were never his thing even before AI, and stuff he worked on often didn't have especially interesting backgrounds. So he is still doing what he likes to do, but now with something that makes some of the work flow faster. And people who come there for his character art will still get to see hand drawn characters by him. People may like or dislike that he does this, but he isn't hurting himself by automating minor details in the workflow. And if there's a problem it's with capitalism.",

It's not a database of pictures that it frankensteins from, it scans things to learn what a \"cat\" is statistically based on millions of pictures. That's not considered plagiarism because if things are sufficiently transformative it is considered distinct, and since it's not based on any one thing there is no specific thing to connect it to. And observation of publicly available pictures isn't legally stealing either, otherwise normal artists couldn't learn from them.\n\nLike yeah, it *can* be used to plagiarize if someone makes a version based on a specific artist. But no one would do that for anything they intend to actually sell on a large scale, because they'd get sued immediately. And it was already possible for people to just copy stuff and edit it and claim it was their own, ai wasn't needed for that. \n\n>As a creative, I'm pretty worried to see what happens next for artists, authors etc. AI is a real problem for designers and people who self publish, as people are uploading AI drivel to print on demand platforms and soaking the market with crap so real art is harder to find. \n\nTbf AI books are atrocious, so no one is going to read those instead of real books. I doubt ai will be good enough to write real books, because it can make surface level aesthetics, but the logic of connection is a lot harder. \n\n>I think AI can be a good tool when used well, but when it comes to the creative space I think it's a travesty and goes against the Creator's intention in how we are made to create.\n\nThe thing is, what ai does was already a thing artists did for eons. In the past master artists would often fill in the important details of a painting themselves and then have novices do the busywork for the small details. So they were already handing off a bit of control to other people often who would get little to no credit for it. Ai is just that same idea but faster. And it's not much different than photos or photoshop. Photos are actually more directly copying imagery, since unless you only photograph nature, you are photographing designs other people made to repurpose for art. And photoshop already had tools designed to automate some of the art process.\n\nYeah, if people produce a lot of slop it will be bad. But every generation produces a lot of lazy stuff. If anything ai might decrease open plagiarism, because in the past people would steal and slightly edit entire images or snippets of text, and if those people use ai instead and people roll their eyes it's less intrusive to any one individual.",

Again, its not saving a database of images. Its just looking at publicly available images to add to its understanding of what a cat is. If it doesn't produce something that looks like any of these images, then its not plagiarizing. Human artists could look at them and copy their style as long as they don't produce and try to sell something too similar. It makes no sense to treat machines differently.\n\n>Regarding books, yes it is utter slop, but the problem is the volume at which it is being generated and uploaded to POD platforms mean real authors have less room for discoverability. It is drowning the market.\n\nI dunno, on the author places I go like royal road, AI stuff gets rated badly so much it largely disappears from visibility, and they have to tag if it is ai written, so people can just skip it. Bigger issue is that on something like amazon you need to be an adult with a card to buy stuff so the ratings are usually real, whereas on free amateur sites there's no floor to the age of people using the site, so anyone who wants can give whatever they want bad ratings just to try to elevate what they like. So its pure chaos to try to be discovered.",

Here is a news article from NBC.\n https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/deus-machina-swiss-church-installs-ai-jesus-connect-digital-divine-rcna182973\n\nI think by consulting an AI for spiritual advice, we risk replacing God with an idol.  I can see it being OK to look stuff up, but to confess to it or take it's word as a spiritual authority is very bothersome to me and seems downright sacrilegious, imo.",

Whether it is used as a tool, a weapon, a deity, or anything in between, it is certainly a testament to our fallen nature. As far as potential, I think it's more significant than our discovery of nuclear power. It almost certainly eclipses the potential destructive capability. Rather than splitting at atom, we have learned to divide an already atomized society and culture. Look at the algorithms that control the flow of information on our devices. Revelation speaks about deception increasing as the end approaches. Whether the enemy will use this tool in his final deception is unclear, but certainly possible. I don't trust it. Even if it's not part of prophecy, it's still a very big step in a direction that has taken us far from anything resembling the life a natural human being was made for.",
