If we say that the decisions made by a.i. cannot be racist because the a.i. is not intelligent, then we can either offload behaviors originally motivated by racism onto these robots or just not give a crap when they learn to do things that would be racist, like targeting individuals for police surveillance on the basis of skin color, and when any concern is raised, it can amount to no more than an admission that something must have gone terribly wrong, but nothing racist ever occurred, because it can't occur.\n\nI think society will eventually be forced to consider how these terms apply to the processes and criteria used to make decisions in perceived \"racist\" discriminatory actions, be they from humans or a.i., in order to protect ourselves from the misuse of a.i. or its malfunctions.",

If we are going to actually grow as a species and come together for our mutual prosperity we have to overcome these deficiencies.\n\nThe good thing about AI is it can learn from everything available to it and not die... it just keeps learning forever. The notion that this is more dangerous than a human trying to get as much shit as they can in their short 80 years is absurd.\n\nI am far more worried about humans continuing to be in control because we're fucking evil as a whole.",

Pixel color values are among the features of the data set because, why not?\n\nBecause it's a continuously learning model, training is continuous.  Its training data is unbalanced because the population it picks up on the cameras reflects only the local reality and majority population of minority descent.\n\nNow, let's say it does its job with quantifiable effectiveness, and, for whatever reason, someone decides that this effective model can and should be frozen and propagated to other areas of a city because of its effectiveness, except, those other areas happen to be shopping centers in a high-income area of the city where the population has nowhere near the same concentration of people of the same minority.\n\nWe should not be surprised if the cameras fail to identify criminality among peoples of a different color of skin than those it was initially trained on, or if it shows a bias toward those who are of that minority.\n\nAnd further, do recognizable features such a skin color really have anything to do with criminality, or was economic disadvantage a factor?  The machine doesn't know or care, and neither does racism.\n\nP.S. this has happened in the real world, where the training sample was unfortunately too biased, unintentionally, and that bias can and does end up creating problems people see as discriminatory.",

The worst thing you can say about a statement is that is false, and the worst thing you can say about an argument is that it is invalid. Accusations of racism and sexism are what people substitute for those cricitisms when they know the statements they are critizing are true, or the arguments they are attacking are sound.\n\nSo, the article states that AI was sexist because it associated terms like \"woman\" and \"female\" with arts and humanities and \"man\" and \"male\" with the harder sciences. But then the article points out that only 18% of computer science graduates are women. That is, the AI was correct - men are in fact more associated with hard sciences than women are. Acknowledging that association is of course politically incorrect, unless doing so is immediately followed by a condemnation of sexism in society, but that the AI made the association shows only that the AI was working properly.",

What I find racist is \"[Blanks] (since it could be a few different groups) are statistically more likely to commit murder, *because by virtue of being Blanks, they are more violent, lawless people.*\" And technically, I can attack the second part of the statement as being factually untrue. But, generally speaking, the person isn't attempting to express a fact; they're expressing their animosity to others based on group membership, and yeah, I'd be okay with someone calling that out as racist, even if they hadn't literally done some sort of public opinion survey to find out people's attitudes towards the law and the use of violence.\n\nSo in the end, I guess it depends on what you call racist, and why.

You are incapable of arguing that the person doesn't prefer to work only with white people, so you are forced to condemn it as racist.\n\n>Actually I don't. What I find racist is \"[Blanks] (since it could be a few different groups) are statistically more likely to commit murder, *because by virtue of being Blanks, they are more violent, lawless people.*\" \n\nI mean, that is poor reasoning because it is tautological, as the second half merely restates the first half.

Which was basically my original point.\n\n>To link your examples, \"I'd prefer to work only with white people because non-White people are statistically more likely to commit murder so it's not safe to work with them,\" would strike me as racist, not because it references the statistics, but because it uses those statistics to cast a broad net over an entire group of people in the name of \"justifying\" a racialized preference.\n\nBut this surely is merely a matter of levels of risk aversion. If you knew that 100% of the members of a group X would end up trying to kill you, you would presumably avoid all members of that group. At 90%, you would probably still keep your distance, even though that would be \"unfair\" to the ten percent who would never dream of harming you. \n\nAnd even fairly low percentages might be unacceptable if you have repeat offenders. Imagine, for example, that, say, oh, 4% of men were rapists, and 96% of men were great guys who would never dream of interefering with a woman. But, the 4% who a rapists are serial offenders who average 6 victims over the course of their lives. In a world where there are an equal number of men and women, that would lead to 1 in 4 women being assaulted over the course of their life times (assuming no overlap in victims for simplicity's sake). In such a world, women might cross the street when passing a strange man on the street at night. \"Unfair\", of course, to the 96% of men who would never harm them, but it also seems a rational choice given the level of risk involved.",

You are conflating *correlation* (men are more likely to commit murder than women) with *causality* (men are, by virtue of being men, more violent and lawless than women). Therefore the latter part of the statement is *not* a restatement of the first. The reason why men are more likely to commit murder may be due to another factor that is independent of being a man. This would allow me to subdivide men into groups based on other factors, and show differences in the propensity to murder based on that. For instance, employment status. If being a man were the causal factor, one should always see roughly the same rate of conviction for murder in men who were employed prior to the crime versus unemployed. Or wealthy versus poor. Or married versus unmarried. Or mentally sound versus mentally ill. Or living in the United States versus the United Kingdom. But we know that *all* of those factors (and others besides) play a role on whether any given man will wind up murdering someone. Were simply *being a man* the causal factor, you would see roughly similar rates of murder across all of the categories above.\n\n> In such a world, women might cross the street when passing a strange man on the street at night.\n\nBut that's not the point that's been made. You're also saying that women would be justified in systematically rejecting men from employment in workplaces they controlled, thus potentially depriving them of the ability to earn a living, simply on the basis of that assessment, without needing to do *any* other work to make a personalized determination of risk. And that the charge of \"well, that's sexist\" is nothing more than an admission that these women don't want to work with men, or that some number of men are rapists.\n\nI see what you're getting at. You're essentially arguing that people may have valid, rational reasons for attitudes and behaviors that others consider discriminatory, and simply calling people out as discriminatory doesn't address any of that reasoning. And that it doesn't matter anyway, because any sincerely-held assessment of risk is a valid reason for biased behavior towards entire groups of other people.\n\nIf your point is that people have no obligation to act in ways that don't disadvantage whole swaths of the population due to surface-level understandings of selected demographic patterns, then argue that. I'm sure you'll find takers.\n\nIf your point is that the term \"racist\" is employed more often than it should, because there are better ways of having the debate, I think that you're overarguing it, but that's fine, too.",
