We have tons of competition they have to deal with and this forces them to continue working in their products rather than sitting around gathering money. \n\nThe white Silicon Valley model is that a crazy kid with a dream makes some new tech that could have a big impact and then it gets bought up by one of the giants. Yes this can mean that the tech isn't getting released but it is proof that A) you don't have to be rich to make Google scared, and B) Google keeps being forced to transfer wealth to these start ups in order to maintain its position.\n\nRight now we all have access to smart phones and the Internet that allow us more power than we've ever had in history. Having the phones locked down to a small handful of companies is not ideal but the app space is clearly wide open as we constantly have new apps show up from small providers. \n\nThere is both a widening and a narrowing of the economy. The best part though is that we have the capacity to fight that widening (through actions like the recent court case against locked down app stores) while the big companies have almost no tools to keep us from getting empowered. Google doesn't want AI to exist as it is a threat to much of their core business. They can't shut it down though so they are forced to spend billions of dollars to build tools that threaten their ad based revenue model.",

I don't see any way China and America could possibly agree to limit themselves in any capacity while trusting the other side to also limit themselves. \n\nDo you really think that an American for profit company would go out of its way to help a foreign citizen, when it could be instead focusing that effort on making shareholder profit? AGI is going to come from one of the massive tech giants who have the hardware to train a 100T parameter model. It's a matter of having resources to actually train at massive scales. Look at Mixtral 7x8B, that's less than 70B, and it can beat proper 70B models - but training it takes a lot of compute power, even if a Quant version can run locally on a consumer 4090. The corps will have it first, simply because they have the money. They are spending wild amount of money now, they aren't going to give it away for free. \n\nAlso - it takes far less than 0.000000001% of the population to be evil and smart enough to either be inside a Corp working on it, or maliciously gain access to it. That API key better be more secure than nuclear launch codes. It only take a single person with the will to do catastrophic damage to set all of humanity back ages, if not completely wipe us out. If Kim in NK gets ahold of AGI/ASI, I'm sure he won't be using it to feed anyone. \n\nIf a catastrophic, (truly catastrophic) event occurs, there will be no time to correct course. It's game over, for everyone. Matrix style slavery or extinction. \n\nYou keep mentioning non-profits, you know that some of largest scams and money laundering occur through them, right? Being non-profit doesn't = good, automatically. \n\nYou have rose tinted glasses, and are painfully unaware of how global power structures are motivated. They exist to control, dominate, and subjugate. Inequity is a feature, not a bug, for them. Given them super intelligent power is only going to exacerbate an already serious problem.",

Sort of a \"Grass is greener\" situation\n\nThere's a lot more that you need to do for survival other than finding food and cooking it. There's also finding and maintaining shelter (+ clean water), defending your territory from predators, finding and processing medicine, finding raw materials for tools, extracting raw materials for tools, processing raw materials for tools, and then only actually building the tools\n\nAnd hunting. Don't even get me started on hunting. I hope you like running for several hours a day, because you're gonna need to once the local wildlife realizes that *you're* a predator. Snares, traps, and ambush hunting only get you so far, you're gonna need to get used to cardio\n\nIt's literally nonstop work. If you're somewhere fairly hospitable to human life, it's nonstop work that happens to keep you alive. Probably. Unless you trip and break your leg. Or a squirrel with rabies finds you. Or winter just really, really sucks that year\n\nThere *are* guys who want to live that way anyhow, and enjoy fucking off into the woods for months at a time. They still have the good sense to bring modern tools made from steel, and none of them are going to tell you that you have to work less hard",

But, will the little people see any of it?\n\n\"Ai\" goves a competative advantage to those who can apply it (better than others) in any commercial area. Some industries can benefit more than others, but all are touched substantially as of today.\n\nTechnology _does seem_ to exaserbate \"winner takes all\". To the point where mega-corps near-dominate in a handful of industries symaltaneously. (By law they cannot go above a certain threshold in any one area)\n\nBut it also democratises. We have unparalleled access to training, knowledge, and other people. Smaller organisations are more agile, moreso with AI. \n\nIt seems likely that AI helps smarter/adaptable people more. Perhaps a LOT more. \n\n\"Jobs\" is harder, because its about work-per-role. Does the role exist, is there work for that role, (has the role changed/can the person do it)\n\nAi will take existing work, and create new work. Obviously, it'll create less work than it replaces, else _you wouldn't bloody do it_. This further increases pressure on smarter workers. AI is also adaptable, so those \"scaffolding\" roles may quickly be automated also. \n\nIs the economy a zero-sum-game? Sort of yes, sort of no, but maybe in a time of recession: its actually a negative sum game. \n\nIf i earn more, do you earn less? Kind of. \n\nAI enables companies to do better and/or charge less. \n\nThe \"dead weight\" you'd have thought would drop away. But even being \"behind\" might be fatal (dying business cannot innovate enough to even catch up) Agressive futurism is required immediately (!)\n\nGovernment is too slow and clunky to really matter here. They are inevitably behind the times. \n\nI feel like nations pecking-order could change with AI. \n\nPerhaps: here's the kicker: the old model of \"the wealthy create jobs\" is wrong. Perhaps equalising wealth, creates a more productive society due the ability to apply the workforce (wealthy enough to train/innovate) though i feel like training might already be best done to GPUs not great apes. \n\nIs smart the same as adaptable? Dunno. Same ball-park. \n\nInequality (in extremes) seems fairly obviously a rot. An ineffeciency. Essentially a symptom of a \"corrupt\" ruling class. _Redistrobution_ is the role of governments. Government seems fairly detatched from AI, and not effecient at finding optimal solutions for nations. At best, the work would come from univercities. Even openAI - to their credit, have been pushing _politically_. \n\nSo, the answer!\n\nInequality is set to increase (until government acts)\nPoverty is set to decrease, for those in work. And, in _nations_ in work.\n\nNations borrowing is getting quite \"choppy\", and an economic shock (like mass unemployment) might make borrowing hard for countries. Thus potentially up-ending the world order. Or, more likely, increasing international inequality. Richer countries are more educated, and \"do smarter work\" (is that true?!?!)\n\nSo, be smart, and aggressively automate. Or perish. \n\nOh, the above is about \"5 years\"\n\nIn terms of \"when we have AI overlords\" you can only hope they'd be on our side, and if so, it feels like inequality isn't so useful. In videogames, you don't get \"landed gentry\" (at the outset). So, it seems thats not how groups best get on.",

            "author": "GeertCF",
            "body": "AGI+ will have huge impacts in ways most people won't see coming, just like with the industrial revolution. It took the Industrial revolution about 100 years before the normal people could talk about a better life after the industrial revolution, then before. Normal people could change the industrial revolution in their favour, because they were still necessary for productivity output, so they had negotatiotion power. It is very doubtful if normal people will have negotiation power this time around. [https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/industrialization-labor-and-life/)  \n\n\nLet's consider for the sake of simplicity that AGI+ is aligned with at least 1 human (and is not an agent (or group of agents) of it's own with its own goals and desires, regardless of what humans want).  \n\n\nFirst off all, we have to establish if 'we', humans, want to help other humans. And the sad answer is: no, not really. In our direct circle of influence, yes, we want to help each other and/or gain respect/status (to produce more copies of our genes). But if we enter the more abstract realms, we don't care, as we don't feel emotionally tied to people we don't know. A real world example: Few people are buying fair trade food or products, because they are simply expensive and don't give us a direct advantage, and we don't have a relation with the people who suffer from us not buying fair trade. Or look at the thousands of people working for big companies that do questionable things (Oil, Social media, etc.). Mostly their argument goes like: \"If I don't work here, someone else will\". This is true on all levels, from employees who make the decisions in those companies, to the employees who are only secretaries or cleaners.  \nAnd if you look at the past, you can see that we had the tendency to treat people who we can see daily, also very badly. Like:  \n\\- homeless people  \n\\- slaves  \n\\- serves  \n\\- factory workers in industrial revolution times  \nAlready we have all the ingredients available in our society to send most people to the land of: \"you simply deserved it\". For example, we like to tell each other: \"You can be whoever you want to be\". This also means that if you didn't make it, it is your fault. Or what about the people that \"don't get it\", like the the people that vote left, or right, or religious, or progressive, basically who don't vote like you do. Or what about the 'others' that try to migrate into your countries, that you and your people took so many years to build up.  \n\n\nPeople benefiting from AI's power will most likely come up with excuses to justify their position, like we currently have with 'Trickle down economics' for example. What the exact justification will be, is not clear yet and will probably be found via trial-and-error, but it will come.  \n\n\nUnrestrained AI will probably induce a property driven society, where the people 'having' AI will be in a far superior position. The remarkable thing is that you don't have to have any virtues or special skills to 'have' AI, you simply have to own it. So this means that any person that is lucky to be born or accidentally in the right position, will have posession over crazy amounts of opportunity to amass wealth and power.  \n\n\nNow, this doesn't has to be bad if we could still serve all human wants (and thus live comfortably). The central economic problem is that human wants are infinite, but resources are finite. So either:  \n1. As our wants increase, the amount of humans should decrease  \n2. We can serve the human wants without using more non-renewable resources (for example changes our wants to non-tangible wants, or doing more with the same amount of resources)  \nSo far we have seen that any advancement in better coping with our resources, has only meant that we do more with the same amount of resources (like car-engine efficiency is better and better, yet the consumption/km didn't drop as our cars also got more luxorious, sporty and heavier).  \n\n\n  \nNow, this might seem very bad, but let's see if we can make a positive future with this knowledge.  \nDemocracy  \nDemocracy works well if most of the people have a considerable positive impact on the power of the whole group. Therefore, you see that in well diversified and complex economies, democracy works well, but if you look at strongly centralized economies (natural resource countries), or simple economies (not relying on any special skill of the people), tend to naturally navigate to power concentrated politics. Democracy will be 100% dead when AGI has established, as people will have very limited productivity and therefore no negotiating power or value to the bigger group.  \n\n\nUniversal Socialism  \nThis could be a stable future, where there is the same small group of 10k - 100k people living extremely luxorious  lifes, but as a gesture of good-will they will feed the general population and keep them on a stable level of resource consumption. To keep the general population on a stable resource consumption, expect mass repression, but as long as you love Big Brother, you should be ok. Also, you can do whatever you want the whole day and maybe people find a lot of fun with each other.  \n\n\nAutocracy  \nThis would be a stable future, where power is concentrated in the hands of a few people, with disregard of the rest of the population (as they have no negotiating power as they don't contribute anything to productivity). The population could perish, as long as the 10k - 100k people or so can live extremely luxoriously.   \n\n\n  \nUniversal Socialism seems to be the best option here, but there is always the risk to fall into a Autocracy. How to prevent this?  \n1) as long as the wants of the small group are met (they turn out not to be infinite), they could simply agree to be humane with the rest of the people (why not...). Maybe technologic advancement is so fast that the rate of discovery is bigger then the rate of our growing wants.  \n2) there is no small group of people, but we hand over all the power to AI (without a fixed set of humans in the loop) that let's us humans do whatever we want within a limited set of rules. So anr AI Ruled Society.   \n\n\nAI Ruled Society  \nAn AI ruled society could deliver us humans a fair-ish playing ground. It is based on the fact that AI will have different desires and wants then humans. So, as they have different desires, they could let humans do their things, while they do their own things, living parallel lives, as long as the agreed upon rules are abided. This is like the AI zooming pass us.   \nHuman / AI law might have to be reconsidered from time to time (which might be dangerous, as humans could 'persuade' AI to give power to a small group). So good governance is important.   \nWithin the human parallel universe, there could be a form of democracy (as everyone is equally useless).",
