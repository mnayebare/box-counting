If you interact with other academics, you use scientific english. Nobody is seriously debating societal issues or giving a diagnosis in AAV. \"You be havin cancer\" is obviously not ever said, unless by an unintelligent and insensitive person. \n\nAAV is composed of shorter, non academic words. \"You be in so much pain cuz you got multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis, we finna start you on a 30mg of ondansetron\" Is simply not said. \n\nThat being said, in day to day conversations, there is no reason to assume AAV indicates someone knows less than you.

You should always put your best foot forward in an interview, and you should present your best possible english vocabulary. \n\nAAV is really a makeup of slang terms, intentionally left out words and hyphenations. It could not possibly demonstrate a complex vocabulary when it's cultural tenets and progress has evolved entirely around shortening and removing words while replacing them with slang. You don't apply to a job in slang. You don't communicate a patient's terminal diagnosis without delicate and sensitive language. An esl immigrant doesn't have the cultural understanding to jump in with an AAV speaker, they aren't able to keep up with the missing/replaced words. A suburban white dude might not be able to keep up with an AAV speaker, hell, if you live in atlanta AAV can sound like it's own language. \n\nHere's the thing, a completely uneducated person could speak AAV just by living around that culture. A completely uneducated person could also speak \"white\" english by living around that culture. Neither of these people will be able to demonstrate the communication skills needed by the majority of jobs in this country, so grading a grammatically correct sentence as coming from a more educated person isn't ever going to be racist",

                            "body": ">Context is important. Black people often code-switch depending on the context that they're in, so comparing one sample used in a \"professional\" environment, and another used in a different setting doesn't really hold water.\n\nCorrect, but an AI has no way of understanding context so to an AI AAV probably seems like a lot of gibberish whereas more straightforward dialects are much easier for it to understand. I wouldn't be surprised if AI also had the same issues with Japanese which is also very context clue based. \n\n>The point isn't that there isn't a difference, it's that AI is negatively stereotyping people who use AAV. If companies are using AI to review resumes, or to filter candidates based on their social media presence, this kind of thing can and will result in discrimination, even before their application crosses the desk of a real person.\n\nSo don't write your resume and cover letters in AAV and don't use it on social media either, it's that simple. The world doesn't revolve around the wants and needs of any one group of people; this is something that you are just going to have to accept and learn to adapt to. Personally, I would love to not have to take medication for my ADHD that does terrible things to my body, but I understand that without it I am very annoying to be around and my production level at work would plummet. We can't always get what we want.",

The way I speak at work is very different from how I do with my Black American friends, in certain sections of social media, and even friends from other demographics who may not share my cultural background. To that, my version of code switching can be very different from another person who's from say...Louisiana, California, etc.\n\nI think, what likely happens, is that the largest samples for raw AAVE are likely going to come from lyrics of popular genres that use it and platforms like Twitter, etc- where people are likely to code switch for their demographic.\n\nFurther more, this has a perceived class component since AAVE often closely mimics Deep/Rural Southern speech patterns and I've heard, more than once, how southern accents are associated with being poor/lower class. It's one of the reasons I wasn't \"allowed\" to develop one by my northern parents despite spending many of my formative years in the south. \n\nSo, this kind of thing won't just impact some Black Americans (though that should be enough considering we're citizens here, too), it can also impact people who speak more rural southern dialects in their PERSONAL TIME. \n\nI think expecting a certain level of standardized English for resumes/cover letters makes sense but by the time someone can potentially filter based on personal social media posts (which shouldn't be a thing anyway, IMO) a limited understanding of context, and a disrespect for privacy isn't beneficial for anyone but weirdo control freaks.",

I think expecting or preferring people who assimilate is entirely reasonable.\n\nYou realise that colonialism is at least part assimilation, right?\n\nThat all of the things you are forcing on a group of people, because of your own biases, are not logical, nor are they based in reason, but based on being part of a historically dominant majority, right?\n\nLike, asking a black person to \"not sound black\" is incredibly racist and is in no way reasonable regardless of whether you base it on genetics or not.\n\nYou could also just, not talk the way you do. That would be equally reasonable, from your point of view far as I can tell.",

For African Americans, however, speech-related wage differences are not explained by family background, location or personality traits. Rather, members of the black community who speak in a mainstream dialect work in jobs that involve intensive interactions with others, and those jobs tend to pay more.\u201d",

My bad. There is another paper from the National Bureau Of Economic Research from 2020. I'll link the paper here: \n\n  \n[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working\\_papers/w26719/w26719.pdf](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26719/w26719.pdf)\n\n  \nTLDR of the paper is that there is a strong correlation with localized regional accents and lower wages, and that workers with those strong accents sort away from occupations that demand high levels of interaction with others. \n\n  \nBy the way according to this paper, that 20% figure is probably pretty close, and not just for Southern, but most strong regional accents.",

What you *can* look at, is arrests correlated with income levels, and there is a very clear and obvious trend (regardless of race) that correlates lower income with higher crime.

It has shown me first-hand that we are all just *humans*. They do great work regardless of how they speak or where they were born. Let's stop dehumanizing people based on such differences.\n\nRegarding the \"ghetto dialect\" you mention, they did not choose to be born in an area that primarily uses African American Vernacular English (AAVE). They deserve an equal opportunity to work, to buy food for their families, to afford shelter in a safe neighborhood, and to pursue happiness just like everyone else. They are people, too.\n\nWhen Americans say \"with liberty and justice for all\" in the pledge of allegiance, let's understand that \"all\" does *not* mean \"only specific cultural groups\". We can build a stronger society with empathy and kindness.\n\n>National origin discrimination involves treating people (applicants or employees) unfavorably because they are from a particular country or part of the world, because of ethnicity or accent, or because they appear to be of a certain ethnic background (even if they are not).\n\n>National origin discrimination also can involve treating people unfavorably because they are married to (or associated with) a person of a certain national origin.  \n...  \nThe law forbids discrimination when it comes to any aspect of employment, including hiring, firing, pay, job assignments, promotions, layoff, training, fringe benefits, and any other term or condition of employment.\n\n>It is unlawful to harass a person because of his or her national origin.
