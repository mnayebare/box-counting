Really, you can say almost anything is a \"social construct\" (e.g. after years of emphasising the sex-gender distinction, some trans activists are now moving on to \"sex is a social construct\" too). I think a lot of liberals weaponise the phrase to shut down discussions of race which they don't like (often while elsewhere emphasising that racial identity is one of the most important things in the world and that everyone needs to be hyper aware of it at all times).\n\nI think it's kind of silly. For one thing, it implies that if racial differences do have a stronger foundation in biology, that that somehow justifies racism. It doesn't. I also think it's sometimes wishful thinking, based on the assumption that social/environmental things are easier to change than biology. But often that's not the case anyway - e.g. we're way better at fixing many diseases than we are at fixing poverty or broken political systems.",

Mind you, they don't say our physical characteristics are a social construct, but \"race\" is. For example Irish in the 1800s were not considered white in the US, Spainards still aren't (but in Europe they are). Irish were seen as a lesser people, with a lot of stereotypes attatched to them, but nowadays they i.e. the physical features that are more commonly found among the natives from the Irish island, are considered to be white. So the definition of who is white, as a race, has changed over time to reflect their socio-cultural mindset.\n\nAnother reason is that it is difficult to classify a lot of people into a specific race. For eg, if one takes a look at the (for lack of a better term) natives from South Sudan to Germany, one can observe that their phenotypes change. But it is difficult to say where one race ends and the other begins. For eg, where does the Nilotic race end and the Sudanese begin? Or Sudanese and Arabs? Or Arabs and Turks? It is difficult to say where a race begins and ends. It is difficult to draw such a line, either on a map or on the physical traits that they possess.\n\nSo *kurzgesagt,* our physical features are definitely largely determined by our genes. But which of those features are ascribed to which race (and sometimes the accompanying social stigma/stereotypes) is largely determined by society. That is the reason a lot of people say \"race is a social construct\".\n\nI hope it clears up things for you.\n\nEdit: Another example can be Obama, who is considered a Black man, even though he is mixed race and was primarily raised by  a white woman. If the society surrounding Obama was largely descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans, he might've been considered mixed, coloured or white. So it depends and changes according to society.",

Stop putting words into my mouth-\\_-. Races are humans. Human society changes and our classification of them changes. The more we learn about species, we might actually change their classification (has happened but is rare ik). I am not saying biological classifications are bad or wrong. Just that our classification might change with change in society.\n\nBiological taxonomy changes because our understanding of species changes. Our classification of race changes cause our society and views changes, not because we find out some new quirk about some people group that invalidate their previous classification.\n\n>How are categories decided by society scientific? If they're not, then you are conflating scientific concepts of race with social ones.\n\nSo you think they are scientific? Cuz I think that the boundaries of the classification we use are a social construct. Doesn't mean that they are bad/don't exist/shouldn't be so. It just means that they are decided by society. Could be scientific, could be not. It is not hard science, the boundaries I mean.\n\nEdit: Added a paragraph\n\nEdit 2.0:\n\n>scientific concepts of race with social ones.\n\nSo ig there are 2 concepts of race.

But googling the term produces this result first:\n\nhttps://centerforhealthprogress.org/blog/race-social-construct/\n\n> For hundreds of years, we\u2019ve been told that each race is a discrete group of people defined by specific genetic and biological differences. As a result, we\u2019ve used race as a way of explaining observed differences in health: Sickle Cell Anemia is considered a black person disease; Cystic Fibrosis is considered a white person disease; we\u2019ve said people of color are genetically pre-disposed to diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, and other chronic conditions; the FDA has approved drugs for different races; and through \u201crace-based medicine\u201d we\u2019ve established care standards (such as responding to patients\u2019 pain) that vary by race. But it\u2019s all wrong.\n> \n> there\u2019s no biological basis for race\n\nHere's the second result, called \"What We Mean When We Say Race Is A Social Construct\"\n\nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/what-we-mean-when-we-say-race-is-a-social-construct/275872/\n\nDespite the title, the author fails to even come close to clearly stating what is meant by the phrase. But there is a decided (if hand-wavy) resistance to the notion of biological basis.\n\n> Andrew writes that liberals should stop saying \u201ctruly stupid things like race has no biological element.\u201d I agree. Race clearly has a biological element\u2014because we have awarded it one.\n\nSo no, I don't think I'll accept you're assertion about \"what most people mean\" when they use that phrase.",

That's probably a justified fear to some extent, hateful people will use anything they can to justify their hate. \n\nHere's the thing though, even if it is true that there are physiological differences between the races that extend to the the entire body including the brain it's never going to be morally or logically correct to ever apply that to any individual.

It therefore has no utility in solving practical societal issues.\n\nWhy insist on having a pedantic argument when you don't fully know what the other's position is on categorizing humans into groups? Categorization is useful for solving problems that are specific to those who would benefit from being put into categories. We can argue and debate as to which categorization methods are harmful and which are useful. We can argue about which data points should be used for that categorization as well. In the context of human beings on planet earth, the concept of race, whether illusory or not has a real impact on how we experience our world. You can try to pray that away with studies and idealogy that select datapoints that point to race being an arbitrary categorization. That is fair and probably a virtuous pursuit. But it simultaneously wouldn't be useful until humans as a whole generally don't think in a fashion that places ideas and observations into categories.\n\nIf anything good comes of this A.I. it would be that we can categorize humans in a far more practical way when it comes to creating ideal diets, lifestyle choices, etc, based on biology. I agree that calling it race is irrelevant, particularly for the A.I.. The A.I. is of course not seeing \"race\" in the conventional sense. But it intersects slightly with our own idea of what race even is. That is probably why we tend use that word. I'm hopeful that this technogy can help us break away from our more primitive ways of classifying human needs.",

Yeah, saying the A.I. is doing that is an artifact of our own layman understanding of race. I talk about the possible utility of this in an earlier comment. Without understanding how A.I. \"learns\" I guess this looks nefarious? (I'm not an A.I. programmer either) \n\nOur self reporting of race likely intersects with a better more practical way of categorizing the unique needs of humans based on gene differences and similarities. Will that categorization be race as we describe it today? Likely not, but it will still generally look similar to our own intuition about what race is. It will use better methods for acheiving practical goals related to health, diet, and lifestyle choices. And it'll kinda look like sorting by race to some. Even though that isn't ACCCHHTUAHHLLY what it is doing, as I think that is sort of your point when you keep saying race categorization isn't a useful thing.\n\nSo on to your argument about it not being useful. We live in one of the most race concious time periods in human history (arguably). All universities are talking about it, people are protesting about it, etc.. This A.I. doesn't care what a person self reports, that isn't part of the input right? If people are concerned that A.I. is going to be racist, it's going to have to see race like we do. All of our \"anti-racist\" behaviors require us to see and define race on a regular basis. If an A.I. couldn't do that and correct for it, you would have a possibility to see outcomes that people would interpret as racist or potentially would be racist.",

The article explicitly acknowledges the known average anatomical differences between the races:\n\n\"For example, the bone density test used images where the thicker part of the bone appeared white, and the thinner part appeared more gray or translucent. Scientists assumed that since Black people generally have higher bone mineral density, the color differences helped the AI models to detect race. To cut that off, they clipped the images with a filter, so the model couldn\u2019t color differences. It turned out that cutting off the color supply didn\u2019t faze the model \u2014 it still could accurately predict races. (The \u201cArea Under the Curve'' value, meaning the measure of the accuracy of a quantitative diagnostic test, was 0.94\u20130.96). As such, the learned features of the model appeared to rely on all regions of the image, meaning that controlling this type of algorithmic behavior presents a messy, challenging problem. \"\n\nApparently you missed that part of the article. I don't see the researchers claiming that the racial predictions of the model are *not* due to physical differences. It seems likely that they are. When training machine learning models, sometimes the model will acquire abilities that the creators did not specifically predict or intend, like what happened here. The researchers wanted to know *how* the model was predicting race, and they offer a few explanations that they originally had for this ability,  which turned out to be incorrect. Elucidating the exact mechanism of learned features of neural nets (as this model most likely is) with many hidden layers is a difficult problem to solve, as opposed to models like random forest classifiers, where it\u2019s usually much easier see the exact way the model is making it\u2019s predictions/classifications. This is understandable considering that with neural nets, you are dealing with extremely large numbers of neurons in high dimensions. The researchers are still working on it.\n\nI guess what triggered you is when they mentioned that this presents problems for future machine learning models used in the real world, as this is bound to happen in the near future. As the article says, imagine a machine learning model that has an unknown/unintended ability to detect race, and the model is using this ability to influence its predictions/classifications in an area where we as a society would want to be completely color blind. I can think of many examples: triage of patients, the criminal justice system, etc.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for the researchers to have trepidation about these models, and to want to further understand them before they are used in real-world settings where the consequences could be enormous.",

Like if you ask an AI to sort criminal offenders by their likelihood of reoffending, it might take race into account, even though you don't want it to (of course, human judges do this too).",

We found that patient racial identity was readily learnable from medical imaging data alone, and could be generalised to external environments and across multiple imaging modalities. We strongly recommend that all developers, regulators, and users who are involved in medical image analysis consider the use of deep learning models with extreme caution as such information could be misused to perpetuate or even worsen the well documented racial disparities that exist in medical practice. Our findings indicate that future AI medical imaging work should emphasise explicit model performance audits on the basis of racial identity, sex, and age, and that medical imaging datasets should include the self-reported race of patients when possible to allow for further investigation and research into the human-hidden but model-decipherable information related to racial identity that these images appear to contain. |\n\nThis is the conclusion I saw and from what I can read, it says that the AI is good at figuring out races based on the information given to it. And that we're still not sure why. This could potentially be used to make wrong conclusions on things we know that already exist. And finally that they want to include race information in future test in an attempt to figure out why the AI can come to the conclusions it does.",

So it is not anywhere near as it was in the Soviet Union. Though yes seeping in of politics into research is a big concern.\n\nAnother point that I would like to raise is the politicisation of scientific findings. And specifically the factions that bring up non-research related topics in to question it, or try to politicise it to gain a political following (trying to divide people with misinformation). Not political movements that are based on the findings of research and support it, but the ones that oppose it using reasons that are non-academic and unfalsifiable.\n\nBoth of these points are justified if one looks at the shit-storm that was the political maneuvering around covid. From claiming that there was no chance that it was developed in a Chinese lab (even though that was FAR from conclusive) and that Covid itself was a hoax/mask weren't necessary (or any version of that).",

Your impression of the article isn't the only one possible.\n\nIt seems to me that the author isn't really concerned about \"hidden bias\" so much as the fact that race can be reliably predicted by an AI from x-ray images.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the sort of reactions I've seen from people when they heard about machine learning algorithms that could reliably predict unknown reported mental states from fMRI images of known reported mental states. Some people found this deeply disturbing because they just didn't like the idea that our thoughts are indeed dependent upon brain activity; they want the mind to be somehow independent from the brain because of this is not the case it's hard to imagine the former surviving the death of the latter.\n\nI think there's something similar going on here, but the thing they're afraid of being affirmed here is that race isn't merely an arbitrary social construct.\n\nI e even see some of the same exact objections. For example, I heard many people attempt to downplay the significance of the reported mental state predictions ok the basis that they were merely \"reported mental states\" as though this rendered the entire study insignificant. In this thread I see at least one person raise the exact same objection; that the algorithm was predicting people's _reported_ race in an apparent attempt to shield the cherished \"race is an arbitrary social construct\" narrative.\n\nAlso, t seems to me the article conflates the x-ray study with other studies in which there might have been some genuine bias involved (though some of the examples linked to in the article are _not_ the clear cut cases of _racial_ bias corrupting algorithms they're presented as).",

This is validated by many decades of research.   \n\nThere is a \u201cbroad scientific consensus that when it comes to genes there is just as much diversity within racial and ethnic groups as there is across them.\u201d  The Human Genome Project has confirmed that the genomes found around the globe are 99.9 percent identical in every person. The very idea of different \u201craces\u201d is nonsense.  \n\nStanford scientists examined the question of human diversity by looking at the distribution across seven major geographical regions of 4,000 alleles, the different \u201cflavors\u201d of a gene. They found that over 92% of alleles were found in two or more regions, and almost half of the alleles studied were present in all seven major geographical regions.  If separate racial or ethnic groups actually existed, we would expect to find \u201ctrademark\u201d alleles and other genetic features that are characteristic of a single group but not present in any others. However, the 2002 Stanford study found that only 7.4% of over 4000 alleles were specific to one geographical region. Furthermore, even when region-specific alleles did appear, they only occurred in about 1% of the people from that region! Thus, there is no evidence that the groups we commonly call \u201craces\u201d have distinct, unifying genetic identities. \n\nThe big brains at MIT need to be aware of  cognitive scientist George Lakoff's demonstration that simply using the word \u201crace,\u201d even when criticizing racism, actually reinforces the false belief that human beings belong to fundamentally different groups.  That\u2019s because the more a word is used, the more that certain brain circuits are activated and the stronger that metaphor becomes.  So please, MIT, get your fucking shit together. \n\n\nEthnicity is real, and what the AI is picking up on is almost certainly ethnicity, wrongly thought to be the same thing as race.  There are indeed minor differences between ethnic groups, between populations, but there is no such thing as \u201crace\u201d\u2014only racism. And the consequences of racism\u2014from the African slave trade to the European genocide of First Nations in the \u201cNew World\u201d to Nazi Germany to today\u2019s refugees\u2014are horrific.   So please, MIT and everyone else, please please please stop propping up the bogus and pernicious idea of different human races.",

So is my next door neighbor.  We could be more genetically dissimilar to each other than we  each are  to a random Asian, or more genetically similar to a random African than we are to each other.  Ethnicity is _sort of_ what scientists - geneticists, anthropologists, etc -  refer to as \"populations,\" but looking at populations, there is SO much blurriness and non-specificity that very often one can only say \"this person _probably_ has North African ancestry, but the same markers that lead to that conclusion are found widely in Greek, Turkish, and middle Eastern populations.\"  \n\nIn summary, there are no well defined \"race nations,\" there are no well defined \"ethnic nations,\" and any randomly selected  pair of people share 99.99% of their genes, and the 0.01% that may be different cannot be attributed to any particular place of origin.  Genetic variaations which are limited to one region tend to be rare within that region, variaions that are common within a region tend to be shared across the globe, and most differences between individuals, whether they come from the same region or different regions, are due to global variants. \n\ntl;dr:  the problem is nationalism itself, the very common but mistaken notion that one is a member of some (imagined) nation and that other (imagined) nations are  inferior to yours.",

For one it just flies in the face of common lived experience. Yes, there are times when it's hard to tell whether someone's from southern Europe or northern Africa - that doesn't mean people (and now machines!) can't easily tell the difference between black and white and Asian Americans. It also does nothing to stop a racist from talking about populations instead of races or ethnicities. Hell, maybe they even believe that southern Europeans are inferior too.

Nor would I, when IMO the problem is the very idea that people who don't look like you are fundamentally different in some way that matters.   \n\nThis is way simplified but:  Our ancestors who left Africa two million years ago had brains that evolution  had  shaped to answer the challenges of dealing with things and animals.  The anterior portions of our brains, where all the social domain processing occurs, evolved over the subsequent million+ years, as the challenge that faced us was us.  By the time modern humanity came on the scene about 200,000 years ago, evolution had given us brains with pretty amazing social skills.  But human society at that time was comprised of  small bands of hunter gatherers.  And so it would remain until only about 10,000 years ago, when we started farming and building cities.  Our brains really suck at dealing with the challenges posed by societies (ethnicities that are numerous and  visually different than our own.  That manifests in, among other ways, as distrust and even animosity, and more fucking nasty behaviors.   Many of us are stupid and ignorant fucks who tend to not even much use what half-ass social skills we do have, instead interacting with the world mostly under the influence of the more ancient portions of our brains, what psychologists call \"our lizard mind.\" (I have to stop here but I encourage you to look up reputable articles  about political alignment and brain structure.  My  fairly recent comment history has some links to such articles, including a very interesting one where the researchers claim to have turned conservatives into liberals, albeit temporary and in a very limited scope.  \n\nThe tl;dr this time is that racism is kind of built into many of  us and at a fairly fundamental level. Defeating racism is a very very very big challenge and I dont know how to go about it except maybe on an individual basis. But then, many people are far more imaginative than I am ,- maybe somebody will figure it out.",

AIs are notoriously bad when it comes to black people. It leads to all kinds of increasing inequalities whether facial recognition software or computerized policing AIs have been very bad for blacks. If we are somehow programming into our AIs a way to determine race even when we are trying to exclude its a problem. Its not hand wringing. There are real dangers for black people where computers are being used. Its just a fact.",
