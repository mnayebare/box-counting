The vernacular has evolved from \u201cpredictive modeling\u201d, to \u201cmachine learning\u201d to the now most recognized Version: AI.\n\nI have noted that big money knows what\u2019s up. I have seen Wall Street react negatively and crush stocks of companies announcing major AI spend b/c anyone worth their salt knows a huge chunk of it is hype.\n\nThis reminds me of the hype like 20 years ago where Fortune 500 companies thought they could outsource their true analytic capabilities to consulting companies. (By analytic I mean true machine learning capabilities. It seems the word analytic gets tossed around much too easy these days to represent Mickey Mouse level analysis). The consulting companies would basically sell hype and implement some cookie cutter suite of machine learning models. These consultants had zero understanding of the nuances of these businesses and would miss out on a ton of predictive ability because without this knowledge you are going to build your variables wrong. \n\nThis is going to happen with AI as well. A lot of the AI that is receiving hype is essentially a Google V2.0, where Natural Language Processing is embedded on the highest scoring google results so it gives you a semblance that a human is talking back the google results to you. It will still render errors the same exact way googling and depending on the top 1-5 results would. \n\nTo truly implement AI the way many people are perceiving, you\u2019d have to have mini-AIs for every single domain of human understanding and have experts feed it every single rule imaginable related to the domain and communication in general. You have to think of it like teaching a gifted child, whose gift is insane processing power. But you have to teach it every little thing. And then hope no one feeds it misleading rules and/or data as truth.\n\nThere was a term in grad school that is analogous to the rubbish I see in AI and it will probably be prevalent for as long as I live. It was called \u201cKitchen Sink Modeling\u201d. It essentially entailed just blindly dumping all variables into a model and let the model guide you for subsequent iterations of the model(s). These were basically lazy people who didn\u2019t want to do a thorough univariate/multivariate analysis before moving on to building models and comparing performance. \n\nYou would think, that at least some of the Fortune 500 companies have at least 1-2 smart people. So my cynicism suggests, what they are doing now is cost containing labor cost. Mass fire a bunch of people b/c everyone else is doing it too. Then when the next wave of demand occurs you begin hiring back at lower salaries bc labor has no leverage or option.",

With pretty much everyone using AI these days, the replacement often has some AI part. I think it's more sensible to look at broader long term (like ten years) employment trends per type of work and industry than to make a one-dimensional analysis.\n\nEnd of the line is that most industries don't see substantially lower employment than pre-corona. I don\u2019t think much of the layoffs we see now have to do much with AI even if some individual jobs may be 'replaced by AI'.\n\nI think there may be some very specific industries like translation that were doing pretty poorly even 10 years ago and are attrocious now with a little AI push.",
