                    "body": "You're reading too far into this. They're trying very hard to be inclusive by giving the neural nets diverse inputs. When you ask for a successful business woman image, they want it to generate images of white women, black women, Asian women, etc. This requires a lot of tricky training regimes to avoid biases in the data, because the image set may have more images of white women.\n\nThe unintended consequence is you might get diverse Nazis or something like that. Neural nets are fickle things. You cannot just tell it rules like \"don't create black Nazis\". That's not a way you can interact with the neural net.\n\nIn summary, these issues are likely because they are spending a lot of real effort making them diverse, not because they don't care.",

The trainings, the memos, the full on wall paintings with inclusive quotes, etc. The employees are really proactive in being aware of it too, and implementing it. There are lots of genuine and fair criticisms of Google, but the effort they put into inclusivity needs to be recognized because it's ridiculous how hard they try. I can honestly say I have never seen a private company or government agency try this hard.",
