If not, which appears to be the case based on the article, then it would seem that these differences--if they exist--are not large enough to be predictive and therefore likely not large enough to be medically useful.\n\nAs for the Ainu people, that would depend completely upon what physical differences the AI would uncover through training. Since they have mixed with Japanese for so many generations and have been diluted through genocide, I would hazard a guess that it would identify them as whatever it would identify Japanese as.\n\nThe classification of other geographic ancestries may or may not line up with how we would classify people by \"race\" as it is currently constructed. It's not something that can be predicted without training the AI. \n\nWhat is making the scientists uncomfortable in this case is that the features the AI is detecting (whatever they are) appear to be able to accurately categorize people in a way that fits with our conceived notion of \"black\" as a race. This might not hold true for other \"races,\" but certainly seems to in this case, with a 90% degree of accuracy. Based on my reading of their statements, the scientists look to be downplaying this result to avoid that conclusion.",

My father does too but he's Scottish... and a laborer - you can build bone density by lifting or putting stress on your bones, so a lot of the differences do come from if you are a laborer or not, but I think a lot of it is genetic given that I had that super high bone density before I even started lifting weights.  I played video games all day as a kid and somehow have bones like wolverine and I suspect its similar with the differences between ethnicities on a high level.  However, to overall broadly say Africans have stronger bones would likely be wrong given that the diversity of genetics amongst African's is actually greater than between African's and Caucasians!

No, osteoarchaeologiste are not 100% accurate, but who knows if AI could be?\n\nFrom the article:\n\n>So, while AI might be able to determine from an X-ray whether a person\u2019s ancestors were from Scandinavia, Africa or Asia, Goodman says it\u2019s not about race. \u201cYou call this race. I call this geographical variation,\u201d said Goodman \u2014 but he did admit it\u2019s unclear how AI could detect geographical location from an X-ray.\n\nIt's a sad day when social considerations are so strong that they impede scientists from arriving at the obvious conclusion.",

Obfuscating the results by saying \"we have no idea why this AI can detect race based on someone's bone structure; bone structure is based on geographic origin and not on race\" serves no purpose and directly avoids answering the question posed. The fact is that the researchers are perfectly capable of answering that question; they just prefer not to either because it makes them uncomfortable on a personal level or they feel socially pressured to dance around the issue. Bone structure is, in fact, at least loosely correlated with race; it is simply lying to claim otherwise.",

And that there are absolutely no other correlations of physical traits and racial categories? Please think carefully about what the word correlation means before you say no and I provide links to evidence that says otherwise.\n\nI am not claiming that \"race\" is an objective reality; all I am claiming is that it does have some degree of predictive power. The categories that humanity has constructed are not entirely arbitrary and ephemeral. In most cases, they *coincidentally* do correlate to varying degrees with geographic ancestry, which makes race itself a construct with some degree of validity, i.e., it is not 0% predictive. \n\nThe researchers pretend that the reason the AI can identify race is mysterious because they don't want to acknowledge that race has any correlation with the physical world. They go to great rhetorical lengths to dance around the easy explanation that exists, the one I mentioned above. This is not the action of a scientific mind, but of one that is driven by ideological considerations.\n\n**Edit:** With respect to the AI, the issue is that it can predict race without considering \"geographic ancestry\" at all. In other words, the chest x-rays of two darker skinned people who most would identify as \"black\" but who may have different \"geographic ancestries\" share something in common that humans cannot detect; therefore, the AI is classifying them both in a racial category that the researchers would rather believe has absolutely no validity. The fact that the AI is able to do this suggests that the category does have some physical basis, a conclusion that the researchers are obfuscating for questionable reasons. \n\nThe fact that there is some validity to \"race\" *does* make it useful in certain medical contexts, i.e., you can make a reasonably accurate guess when dosing certain drugs or improve interpretation of certain blood test results. The alternative would be to intentionally ignore this useful information and wait for the results of a DNA test; I hope I don't have to explain how stupid that is when health is on the line.",

What is racist is not to admit this fact, but to believe that these measurable differences have any effect on  someone's intrinsic worth as a human being, on their potential, on their moral character, etc.",

What I was saying is that race is a loosely fit categorization that does encompass significant physical properties. Many of those properties, genetic and biological, can be measured as different between the groupings; some cannot and are based on those historical and geographical factors. The fit of the categorization of race is predictive of many things, but it is not a 100% fit.\n\nThe rest of my post proposes that it's not racist to acknowledge the differences that do exist in congruence with racial categorizations. What *is* racist is to ascribe an outsized importance or judgment to those differences.",

Geographic correlation in how imaging is conducted, e.g. subtle differences in training lead to subtle positioning differences of subject in imaging. Geographic correlation of machine characteristics, such as suppliers and distributors providing machines that behave slightly differently. Geographically correlated effects of environmental exposures: air, water, and dietary differences could lead to subtle differences in bone density or body composition that are detectable on machines. Geographic correlation in behavior: exact bone structure, joint structure, etc may be influenced by behavioral differences between geographic regions.",

Meaning, Africans are super, super diverse and lumping black people together as one thing is actually crazier than pointing out differences between other ethnicities to Africans.  They are more different than themselves than they are different than other races and thus this whole genetic grouping by ethnicity is outdated and silly.  I actually don't think many scientists in the field seem to know this, as one myself.  I learned this from building polygenic models for disease prediction and studying this field for 6 years\n\nSo what I'm saying in a clearer way is that any given African could be further genetically from another African than they would from a Caucasian person of similar genetics.  The diversity amongst African's, genetically, is just far greater than other ethnicities like Caucasians, which to some people might seem strange because of the changes in phenotypes like eye color or hair color across Caucasians.",

In general I think it's fine (and even necessary when it comes to risk for diseases or responses to medication) to make observations of the population as a whole.  Where it definitely goes into racism is if you cherry pick one or a few attributes of that population and then make logic leaps as to how individuals or a group should be treated in society.  It's also necessary to make sure that whatever metrics you're using to measure a population aren't potentially biased in some way themselves, such as arrest statistics or something founded on subjective behavior.  In your example, a disproportionate number of marathon winners do come from Kenya.  It becomes definitely racist if you then assume that athletes are less smart and therefore refuse to hire a Kenyan you've never met even if they have the same credentials as someone else.\n\nI look very caucasian, although I do have some sub-saharan african genes.",

Africans evolved on open plains, while Caucasians evolved in caves and in the woods (more hiding places). Africans had a higher need for speed and denser bones due to the higher probability of attack from animals or other people so they evolved denser bones and bone structures fit for running. Caucasians could simply hide or be sheltered from threats. Also, it\u2019s well documented that Caucasians are better at swimming, maybe partially due to less dense bones (more buoyant). \nAgain, this might already be known or something, just my 2 cents.",

So it\u2019s not surprising at all. Skin tone is one minor difference across the varying human races. It might be the most easily visible to humans but it\u2019s just one of thousands of physical differences. There used to be other human like species on the planet. These other species intermingled with homo Sapiens  and this mixing didn\u2019t happen evenly everywhere. Also we cannot account for all ancient human like species. So our ancient ancestor we share with everyone alive today actually interbred with other species and did this on different parts of the globe. This is the theory for why there are such stark physical differences among varying races of people today. So we all have homo sapien dna, but each race has varying degrees of other human like species within them. Thus the differences. Also evolution plays a role, however this inter-specie admixture is becoming more mainstream as the science matures.",
