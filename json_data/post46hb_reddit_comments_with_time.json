That's how programming works. I'm also quite sure that the views expressed by US based ai programs will not be 100% matching of all views of everyone on earth as we all have different views. Regardless of what we want AI to be it's still just a program. Hopefully they will continue to improve and they'll be as close to unbiased as they can get.\n\nYou have not seen evidence of a lot of things in existence and yet it still exists. Other people may have observed it, or you share the AI programs biased points of view and are unable or unwilling to see anything else. You didn't get the right answer because you didn't ask the right questions. \n\n\"Yes, AI models like me can be influenced by the data they're trained on, including any biases present in that material. AI systems learn from vast amounts of text data, often sourced from publicly available content like books, websites, and forums. If that data contains biases, whether political, social, or otherwise, these can potentially be reflected in the AI's responses.\n\nHowever, AI developers generally aim to minimize these biases by employing diverse training data and implementing safeguards to ensure more balanced outputs. Despite this, complete neutrality is difficult to achieve, especially in contentious areas like politics or religion.\n\nProgrammers can also influence AI indirectly by deciding what data to include or exclude and how the model is fine-tuned, though the best practices in AI development typically involve striving for impartiality and fairness.\n\nStill, it's always good to approach any AI-generated information critically, especially on complex topics.\" From ChatGPT.\n\nI guess you skipped past the Gemini controversy already. The gender debate. Etc. ask it hot button topics, have a debate with it, play the devil's advocate, and you'll be able to see the points of view it was created with. \n\nEven the ai told you none are free of bias, just minimize it. Not everyone agrees with everyone, so obviously it'll be programmed one side over the other. They are improving as it's called a work in progress. You assume 100% unbiased because it tells you it isn't. Experiment. They have improved over the last year, but there were a lot of complaints. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37928447/#:~:text=Abstract,has%20a%20left%2Dlibertarian%20orientation.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35378902/\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/antoniopequenoiv/2024/02/26/googles-gemini-controversy-explained-ai-model-criticized-by-musk-and-others-over-alleged-bias/\n\nThere are many examples and studies you can read about.

Good people fight to suppress it.\n\nThe pubmed articles are good. I don't consider Forbes an authoritative source since I can buy editorial in that rag tomorrow morning.  To quote the Fujimoto article: \"ChatGPT manifests less political bias than previously assumed; however, they did not entirely dismiss the political bias.\" That's about right from my perspective. \n\nI'm aware of the regrettable Gemini controversy but I'm not familiar with the product. Happy it was uncovered. The problem was identified as over-correcting against the risk of being racist. \n\nI'm very concerned with the media bias that seems persistent and firmly entrenched.

For example, Microsoft's 2016 chatbot \"Tay\" was quickly manipulated by users to generate offensive content, highlighting the vulnerabilities of AI to bias when not properly safeguarded. The biases often arise from the underlying data and societal prejudices embedded in the sources used for training.\" As per ChatGPT. \n\nWhich was my original point. Even ChatGPT will tell you that you should be careful of the content that it posts because of the reasons I said. You can ask ChatGPT that. People should gather news from multiple sources, and not just from one side, but from both sides and then make your own decision as unbiased as you can.\n\nI'm sure AI developed in different parts of the world will come to different conclusions on a lot of political religious and belief based questions. Whereas a lot of factual base questions they'll probably reach the same conclusion.\n\nIn the news recently, it was quite interesting. If AI falls into the wrong hands, it can be programmed for doing criminal activity. For example, we now have hackers employing AI to help steal crypto and passwords. That is also an easy Google search if you want to check it out.\n\nChatGPT replied \"I believe your concerns about AI bias are valid. AI systems can indeed reflect the biases present in their training data, which might come from culturally or politically skewed sources. While developers strive to minimize bias, the complex nature of AI means it can inadvertently absorb and reproduce societal prejudices. Since AI is shaped by human decisions\u2014both in data selection and model design\u2014it's crucial to approach AI outputs critically and verify them with multiple perspectives, especially on sensitive topics like culture, politics, and ideology.\"\n\nThat being said I still think AI is amazing and I hope to see how they advance in the future and one day hopefully a true AI.",

This is my fifth year teaching and I\u2019m finding out how many teachers just want easy street. I\u2019m teaching with a peer who just uses everything I have plus stuff from a website. Give dittos made by other teachers, teach from slide decks made by other teachers, give other teachers\u2019 tests. Have we no work ethic to make our own material? If we default to having AI do this for us, what are we even doing? My mom was a teacher and my friends dads always had some smart shit today like \u201cthose who can\u2019t do, teach\u201d and asking AI to do the work for us just validates that shit in my eyes. \n\nI legit watched a teacher use MagicClass to whip up a slide deck for a class he has no business teaching (not trained in it, very aware he has no business teaching it) minutes before the class. and stumble through it. He never even fact checked it!\n\nI understand using a calculator - it\u2019s for complex problems that we don\u2019t need to focus on because our job isn\u2019t the math, it\u2019s determining what to do with the math. With AI, if it\u2019s doing the job of creating lesson plans, grading, provide feedback, then what the hell are we for? The analogy doesn\u2019t work for AI and teachers like it does for calculators because building your class IS part of what you should be focusing on. When you build your class, you are a better teacher.\n\nFor those who say they use it for inspiration, I\u2019ll go back to the hunting skill I mentioned for students: if you want to be inspired, talk to people, read, watch YouTube videos, and then tweak those ideas to be your own. If you just ask AI to give you ideas, you haven\u2019t even gone to the trouble to investigate what\u2019s been done and what you could do.",

You would be doing the parts of your job he can't and making up for the parts he can do (badly).

From my perspective as a teacher, I use it frequently to make my life easier - defining words appropriately, creating work for students, etc - allowing my to have less on my plate so I can focus more on education. On the other hand, many of my students no longer write their own essays, they just get ChatGPT to do it. Until and unless we learn how to fix that, it'll be worse... but I think - or at least, I *hope* - we will eventually learn how to control the technology appropriately.",
