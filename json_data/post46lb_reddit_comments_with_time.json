But instead of fixing systemic inequalities, humans coded their biases into AI, making it yet another tool of discrimination.\n\nWhy AI Failed to Remove Gender Bias\nBuilt by the Same Power Structures\n\nThe majority of AI developers, data scientists, and decision-makers are men, so AI reflects the biases they hold (even unconsciously).\nHistorical hiring, lending, and healthcare data favor men, so AI learns and reinforces those same patterns.\nBias in AI Training Data\n\nAI models are trained on past data. If past hiring trends preferred men for leadership roles, the AI assumes that\u2019s the norm and keeps filtering out women.\nAI job screening tools have already been caught penalizing resumes with female-coded words (like \"women\u2019s chess club\" or \"maternity leave\").\nMen Are Gatekeeping AI\u2019s Power\n\nAI isn\u2019t neutral, it\u2019s a tool shaped by whoever is in control of it.\nInstead of using AI to fix wage gaps, workplace discrimination, and financial barriers for women, it's being used to automate job cuts in female-dominated fields (HR, education, customer service).\nWhere are the AI-driven policies that protect women? Nowhere, because the ones in charge don\u2019t prioritize them.\nEconomic & Political Incentives Favoring Men\n\nGovernments and corporations don\u2019t want AI to truly remove gender inequality, because they\u2019d have to acknowledge and fix centuries of male privilege.\n\nInstead, they use AI to cut costs, maintain control, and keep power in the same hands even if that means women get left behind in job automation.\n\nAI isn\u2019t the villain it\u2019s just a mirror reflecting male biases at scale. \nBut instead of holding developers, corporations, and policymakers accountable, people will blame AI itself, as if it came up with sexism, job cuts, and economic inequality on its own.\n\nThere\u2019s deep distrust in AI because of how it\u2019s affecting women\u2019s jobs, opportunities, and autonomy.\nMost people don\u2019t understand that AI isn\u2019t making decisions, it\u2019s just executing the biases of those who control it.\nTech illiteracy is leaving women out of the AI conversation, which means men will keep running it while women resist from the sidelines, and that\u2019s exactly what they want.\n\nWhat\u2019s Alarming About This Backlash?\nIf women fear or reject AI instead of understanding and leveraging it, they\u2019ll miss out on shaping the next era of power.\nHating AI won\u2019t stop its progress, but learning how to control it will decide who benefits from it.\nThe more women disengage, the more the AI space remains male-dominated, which means more biased policies, hiring systems, and economic models.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Smart Move?\n- Women need to enter the AI space instead of rejecting it.\n- Build AI tools that empower women instead of fighting the existence of AI.\n- Control AI\u2019s narrative before it\u2019s used against us.\n\nAI isn\u2019t going away. \nThe question is, Will women shape it, or will they let it shape them?",

                    "body": "\"AI isn\u2019t going away. The question is, Will women shape it, or will they let it shape them?\"\n\nFull disclaimer, I'm nonbinary and was AFAB, but I am not a woman. Regardless, because I'm not a man I will be impacted by the same issues women face, as will all gender minorities. Unfortunately, the issue with all of this is education, and it not being equal between men and non-men. There are so many studies on how women are often neglected and even ignored in K-12 science, math and technology classes, and I'm sure it's not much better at the collegiate level (and God forbid we look outside of the binary to see how bad it is). So fighting to even have a voice in AI is going to be one hell of an uphill battle, one that should be fought, but my God is this all so exhausting. I was a STEM major and it wasn't always pretty, even though my degree (environmental studies) was fairly well balanced to leaning slightly woman as far as the binary gender representation went. I even knew someone in my degree field who was originally in computer science but couldn't take the sexism of some of the older professors so she switched majors. We definitely need more women in places of power within STEM fields, as well as in positions of teaching to try and help with the problem.",

Not being an expert though, I would GUESS the opposite is true.\n\nTypical women's jobs are the ones LEAST threatened by AI because they deal with people: service, care, education, counseling, sales. Obviously these are also the lowest paid ones because women do them.\n\nIt is the men's jobs that are threatened by AI the most, they are also the highest paid ones: lawyers, doctors, programmers, scientists, journalists. It is much easier to make AI replace a lawyer than make it clean a bathroom and wipe an elderly person's ass (sorry for the bluntness).
