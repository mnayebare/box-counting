Especially for kids, growing up seeing it on TV and their favorite game companies like Bethesda supporting it, makes them more likely to be accepting of it as adults since it won't be some foreign concept they only learned about as an adult",

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month. Amazon donated $1 million to the president-elect\u2019s inaugural fund along, as did OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and several major companies including Ford, Google, Meta and more.\n\nI guess Sam only got as close as Palm Beach before the election but still got a White House meeting (without Elon) https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html",

This ideology isn't in their interest, but it's probably not in their interest to resist either. Not to sound like chatGPT, but I can think of a few reasons they aren't resisting:\n\n\\- There are downsides to resistance - Trump might come after them with antitrust, loss of government contracts, lawsuits, and who knows what else. Look at what Desantis tried with Disney (it didn't work that well for Desantis, but imagine what Trump could do to a company with less public support).\n\n\\- Conversely, there are upsides to sucking up to Trump. [https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/08/technology/sam-altman-elon-musk-trump.html)\n\n\\- Political resistance might not be that effective right now. While Trump is in power and has congress behind him, what can they do? They might donate to democrats during election season, as Microsoft did in 2024 (https://www.opensecrets.org/political-parties/DPC/2024/contributors?name=democratic-party), but what can they do now?\n\n\\- Democrats aren't that much better for business (and may be worse for business in the short term). Trump's protectionism was continued by Biden. Biden also went after some US tech companies with antitrust.\n\nSo they might prefer anybody else be in power, but while Trump is in power they're trying to make the best of it. I'm not trying to absolve them of anything, but I think their short-term interests involve playing nice with Trump.\n\nEdit: Also, Trump's whole narrative involves 'standing up to the establishment'. If he gets in a fight with Amazon, the majority of republicans will love that. Who will be on Amazon's side? Half of the Democratic party is fairly anti-business, and might end up liking Trump more. People who are 'socially liberal, economically conservative/moderate' will side with Google, but how many of those exist anymore?",

I am asking you what you think a communist is, because I know what I think a communist is and there hasn't been anyone remotely \"communist\" anywhere close to power in the US since, well, ever? certainly not in our lifetimes. communists, by my understanding of the term, are probably the most aggressively marginalized political grouping in the US and have been for a long, long time. so I just sincerely have no idea what you're talking about when you say that \"commies\" lost an election or \"failed to consolidate power\" or whatever.\n\nmy sincere guess is that you don't have anything like a coherent idea of what communism is and you don't want one. \"commie\" is just a bad word you can use to make anyone to the left of Donald Trump sound dangerous and radical. but maybe I'm wrong and you've actually thought about this a lot! so rather than assume, I thought I'd just ask.",

They are about leaning away from the bias (or racism/sexism) that some white males in power have that makes them gravitate towards hiring people just like them. \n\nThey are also about expanding the interview process so that it is less biased against candidates that are qualified but don\u2019t fit a particular mold or background. And it\u2019s about increasing the diversity of talent under the assumption (that many believe to be true) that a qualified and diverse team will provide a better more holistic product or service that serves needs better, akin to the idea that a broad swath of ideas and perspectives will round out your approach and offering and get away from narrow thinking and siloed perspectives. \n\nAlso, there is an idea of giving folks a chance if they come from a less privileged background, and trying to look beyond criteria that only the privileged get. Case in point, I once hired a programmer who grew up poor. They didn\u2019t grow up around computers and couldn\u2019t afford the education that others could. They didn\u2019t look and act the part, and they hadn\u2019t had as much time in front of a screen as others might have. But they had a great attitude and aptitude, and ended up being amazing. Note that that candidate was 100% qualified, but companies would need a more diverse and open hiring process to find them. I wouldn\u2019t have found them if I had stuck with a narrow definition of who was \u201cqualified\u201d or not.\n\nLastly, one could argue that minority candidates (and I\u2019m including women and LGBTQ as well as POC) are in some ways more driven than candidates who have had it easy in life, given the extra roadblocks they have had. Who\u2019s going to work harder \u2014 someone on easy mode, or someone who has had to jump over hoops and roadblocks their whole life? [edit added] This applies to white candidates also who have had to overcome challenges. Candidates (of any creed and color) who have had an easy life of privilege are IMO less likely to be used to dealing with adversity and challenges, and IMO are less likely to have the grit and drive seem in candidates who have overcome mountains. I think some people are concluding that I\u2019m saying white people are lazy. I\u2019m not. That\u2019s a lazy conclusion.",

There is nothing racist or sexist about the observation that people of different races, sexes, genders, etc. generally have different experiences of the world. \"-isms\" deny the significance of individual experience because they attribute behaviors to a psuedo-biological mythology of race, sex, and other socially constructed categories.

I don't see how we can now argue that someone is bad for only hiring 60 year old white men. Only thing that comes to mind is that they're shooting themselves in their own foot by missing out on some diverse perspectives. But we've just given up the argument that would make this bad. Which is people of all colors and genders are statistically equally good at programming, therefore you should not screen for that.\n\nOtherwise we would go with of course all of these groups are statistically equally skilled programmers, and everything else. Then there is no point in screening for these groups in applications. Not for the value of diversity either.

And minorities have historically been overlooked even when they were qualified. There's literally tons of data and representation in every form of our culture about this idea. \n\nWe had to make rules because telling people \"just don't be racist\" \"dont not hire a woman simply because she's a woman\" doesn't work.  The same way we couldn't collectively wake up as a society and say \"we all agree on what sexual harassment is and we aren't going to do it anymore.\" \n\nIt's not the best solution to shoe horn minority candidates into things, but it's definitely better than having no protections in place. We can't just wish all the bigotry away though. It takes decades of social pressure and action for things like systemic racism to even be recognized on a large scale. For now, we have to treat the symptoms with things like deliberate diversity in order for us to get closer to being able to fix the root issue.",

If a certain person is incapable of meeting a certain standard, the problem stems from something well before the job interview. It's not on employers to artificially give certain people unfair benefits because of race, gender, socioeconomic backgrounds, country of origin, etc.\n\nAlso, good luck advocating for ripping a person's inheritance away if they came from a successful family, or forcing people to pay other people for any reason you can think of.
