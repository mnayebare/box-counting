Men don\u2019t respond well to men and women are relatively impartial in these studies (I don\u2019t have stats, but I was a small part of running private studies years ago). So in any case where it\u2019s pretty open ended, or has a flavor of simple companionship, and you can only afford or start with one voice, it\u2019s gonna be a woman because that is more acceptable to more people. \n\nThis leans harder as you get into specific cases, but it\u2019s pretty predictable. If it\u2019s a work out/physical use case, it\u2019s gonna be a man. Men will rarely trust a woman in this use case, and women, again, are relatively impartial. But if you only want one voice it\u2019s gonna be a man.\n\nIf you want something more formal and informative, not necessarily helpful then again you\u2019re going to get a man, but more like a professor than a drill sergeant. My guess is a male voice sounds more confident whether or not it\u2019s actually giving the right answer lmao.\n\nIf you\u2019re talking about any kind of sensitive topics like mental health, sexual health, etc it\u2019s gonna be a woman. Women\u2019s voices come across as much more empathetic and caring. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve gotten some heat for saying these things before, but it\u2019s truly what I experienced in the studies. It is not a reflection of right/wrong, it\u2019s a reflection of existing biases. You could, and we all probably should, start saying we should break the gender stereotypes rather than reinforce them with AI. But that\u2019s just not the goal right now for most businesses. The goal is to grow, and playing into expectations is the smoothest way to do that. Once established, and ai is a norm, maybe we can break down barriers with it.",

I read somewhere humans have developed to immediately notice high-pitched sounds(like a baby crying), and that they can listen to them easier.\n\nBasses and guitars are a good example. Traditionally, the guitar stands out the most to most people. And listening to the bass with crappy speakers is much harder than listening to the guitar on the same crappy speakers.",
