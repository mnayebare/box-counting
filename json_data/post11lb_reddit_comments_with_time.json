Trade and Development agency.\n\nIn a\u00a0[report](https://unctad.org/press-material/ais-48-trillion-future-un-trade-and-development-alerts-divides-urges-action)\u00a0released on Thursday, UNCTAD said the AI market cap would roughly equate to the size of Germany\u2019s economy, with the technology offering productivity gains and driving digital transformation.\u00a0\n\nHowever, the agency also raised concerns about automation and job displacement, warning that AI could affect 40% of jobs worldwide. On top of that, AI is not inherently inclusive, meaning the economic gains from the tech remain \u201chighly concentrated,\u201d the report added.\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe benefits of AI-driven automation often favour capital over labour, which could widen inequality and reduce the competitive advantage of low-cost labour in developing economies,\u201d it said.\u00a0\n\n---\n\n Please reply to OP's comment here: https://old.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1jt6t5u/ai_could_affect_40_of_jobs_and_widen_inequality/mlrxaan/",

It's a policy proposal where a UBI is adjusted higher whenever the economy gets more productive / requires less labor.\n\nBy calibrating the UBI payout, we can not only prevent inflation, we can maximize econonic benefit to the average person while also maximizing leisure-time.\n\nToday, because our economy lacks a UBI we generally have to rely on wages and jobs in order to fund consumer spending. This has an unfortunate side-effect: we are forced to create jobs / boost employment for the purpose of distributing income---which is not the same thing as creating jobs because those jobs are actually needed by our economy.\n\nIn other words: due to the absnece of UBI, macroeconomic policymakers are forced to rely on job-creation policies to support aggregate consumer spending instead. This wastes resources and it wastes human time.\n\nAI or no AI, we very likely could already be enjoying much more production for much less employment; but the lack of a UBI from our monetary system actively prevents this desirable outcome.\n\nFor more informaiton, you can read my new working paper on the subject:\n\n[https://www.greshm.org/files/2025-04-01-calibrated-basic-income.pdf](https://www.greshm.org/files/2025-04-01-calibrated-basic-income.pdf)",

It also provides the benefit of freeing people from the need to work, i.e. from the need to care about climbing to a higher \"class\" through labor.\n\nIf your goal is to make everyone a harder worker, and to provide more earning opportunities, UBI probably doesn't make sense.\n\nThat's not the purpose of basic income, however. The purpose of a calibrated UBI is to maximize wealth and leisure for the average person---irrespective of whether or not they are employed.\n\nQuite possibly, the optimal rate of UBI will be much higher than the average wage is today. It's also possible to imagine a world where the vast majority of people live on an ample, continually rising UBI, and only a minority of the population are employed at all.\n\nIn that world, the majority of people all live on exactly the same income: the UBI. This UBI has no reason to be limited to a \"bare subsistence\" level; it can be set as high as possible. In this scenario, whoever chooses not to work is simulatneously richer than the average person is today, but also, technically, the poorest people in their society.\n\nThey also will get richer anytime the economy itself (all of our machines, infrastructure, etc.) get more efficient and productive.\n\nIn this way, a calibrated UBI complicates the concept of \"socioeconomic class\" as we are used to thinking about it. An advantage of UBI policy is that it doesn't require anyone to be upwardly mobile in a \\*job market\\* in order for their income / purchasing power to increase.\n\nThere will always be some people who are richer than others. What UBI does is make the poorest people as rich as possible; and it gives the average person more freedom to refuse paid work if they choose.",

This is what we get when the wealthy decides AI is the answer to deepen their pockets, hoping that people can get employment elsewhere to have income and buy their products\n\nI am not against AI automation, however if it were up to me, I say we are not ready for AI automation just yet.

Supply and demand becomes shaky when only a very select few out of the vast majority is able to purchase the goods or services. The very concept of a job or role that people do in their respective field needs to be completely rethought as well. It is odd to see that we are still clinging onto the current economics as the norm when we are dealing with a new breakthrough that is upending the labor force. One thing does bug me though - how would AI generate revenue in a sense?",

I think I get human health as it would mean less hours, but the reality is people need hours due to rising costs of living and that includes basic necessities like food and water.

I swear, I have seen countless people mention UBI in this subreddit, but none even think that living in a society where the wealth disparity grows wider and the elite only cares about themselves would mean UBI is not going to even be a thing. Let\u2019s actually be realistic\n\nAnd for point 4: what other work? Where are the new jobs?

Assuming that the AI economy *doesn't* go the dystopian way of 90% of humanity being unemployed and unnecesary, economic advances always lead to MUCH higher consumption of everything, including energy. E banking didn't reduce fuel consumption by reducing the need banks have for delivery trucks; it increased it by ten fold with bitcoin mining, and if energy was twice as cheap it would had increased it by twenty fold. Advanced economies consume vastly more.\n\n\n> Profits from AI fed back into redistribution more equitably resolving wealth disparities and equalize resource and energy use from using lower less polluting levels.\n\n\nSocieties don't even redistribute profits from gold mined on publicly owned land. These redistribution sci fi societies remain just as theoretical as when Marx wrote about them.\n\n\n> Reduced speed of economies and consumerism is also beneficial both for the planet and for human health ie 4 day weeks and maybe even 3 day with UBI eventually.\n\n\nAgain, barring an unprecedented never before successfull revolution, AI economies will consume orders of magnitude more and have orders of magnitude more wealth inequality. Americans in 2025 don't consume less than in the 18th century because we invented cars that made transport more efficient.\n\n\n> Reorientation of societies towards more co-operation, more humane concepts of \u201cwork\u201d.

In other words, we could financially enable leisure time.\n\nThe other option? We could choose to create more jobs *anyway;* rather than pursue maximum leisure time or maximum efficiency, we could adopt a goal of *maximum employment.*\n\nOur society has, for centuries, picked the latter option. We use something called \"expansionary monetary policy\" to stimualte more lending and borrowing, in effect subsidizing the financial sector until the aggregate level of employment is as high as possible.\n\nIn other words: we already live in a post-automation economy---we just don't realize it because we've been too busy filling up that economy with useless jobs.\n\nIn our society, workers try to show off how hard they can work, business owners brag about how many jobs they create, and central bankers \"reassure\" the public that they'll do whatever it takes to keep employment high. Somehow, at the same time we all speculate about a future where robots will do our work for us---despite the fact that we've been actively resisting this outcome.\n\nWhether we realize it or not, we've all been indulging in superfluous job-creation; pushing markets towards higher employment not because production strictly requires it, but in order to have a socially acceptable *excuse* to distribute money.\n\nIt's only after our society deliberately decides to \\*stop\\* creating jobs and to pay out a UBI instead that we can discover how much leisure time is actually possible; how much prosperous unemployment is actually sustainable.\n\nCenturies-old popular debates about the possibility of robots or AI taking over jobs in the future are fundamentally missing the bigger picture: that in the present moment, right now, our monetary system is *not* designed to capitalize on technology and labor-efficiency developments. We're all stuck on a job-creating treadmill because we've yet to imagine a better way of distributing money.\n\nIf we want a future where the average person receives more despite working less, we don't need to be talking about robots or artificial intelligence: we need to be talking about money and UBI.",
