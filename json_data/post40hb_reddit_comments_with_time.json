You asserted that it is antithetical to human nature to 'live by committee', I contested that.\n\nRegardless, in some sort of AI-run future, you could absolutely refuse to be a part of that system, it would probably go about as well as it does today: incredibly poorly.\n\n\"No need for accountability or having a spine you just throw your hands up in the air and refuse to even try to be better?\"\n\nYou're tilting at windmills. But even though I had not been making this point I'll say this: Humanity sure has done a bang up job of fucking everything up, all the while having fanciful notions about how it is merely a hop skip and a jump away from godhood.\n\n\"Human beings thinking for ourselves\"\n\nI have yet to see this justified or demonstrated. The notion of an individual human actor, imbued with rational thought free from the bias or influence of others, seems highly suspect to me. Humans look to other humans for social cues, we look to others for signals on how to act and we modulate our behavior based on past/present reactions to our actions. No man is an island, we are products of an environment and genetics far outside of our conception. Do you adopt your own morals because they are \"true\" in the objective sense, or because they make the most sense subjectively? Does the human conception of 'truth', in the ethical sense, proportion itself to what our own societies consider \"true\"?\n\n\"versus off shoring responsibility to something else we made\"\n\nLike bureaucracy? Nations? Governments? Law Enforcement? Doctors? A global network of manufacturing and logistics? Our identities? We 'offshore' our responsibility all the time, you cannot live within civilization without surrendering your responsibilities to varying degrees.",

Speaking out against something horrific that happened after the fact as a kudos to your party speaks volumes about the things they achieve which is absolutely nothing.

Some things don't get through because they need to dangle the carrot to get you zombies enthusiastic about voting for them. With the RoeVWade carrot now lost under a Democrat majority, I think Democrats aren't even worried about dangling carrots for you zombie cultists anymore since they saw you come out and vote for their candidate in the millions who didn't even have a primary process.",

            "body": "As someone who works with AI both professionally and as a hobby, I think this would have some problems.\n\nThe first question will be \"who programs the AI?\"  And also, how is it programmed? As we've already seen multiple times, creating an extremely biased and even racist AI is entirely possible, and can even happen accidentally:\n\n* [Scientists Built an AI to Give Ethical Advice, But It Turned Out Super Racist](https://futurism.com/delphi-ai-ethics-racist)\n* [Microsoft shuts down AI chatbot after it turned into a Nazi](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-shuts-down-ai-chatbot-after-it-turned-into-racist-nazi/)\n* [Google Suspends AI Tool\u2019s Image Generation of People After It Created Historical \u2018Inaccuracies,\u2019 Including Racially Diverse WWII-Era Nazi Soldiers](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/google-gemini-ai-image-racial-inaccuracies-nazi-soldiers-1235919168/)\n\nEven if we eliminate those kinds of biases, political biases are sure to be an issue.  If I train an AI on the works of Thomas Sowell, I will get an AI who loves capitalism.  If I train it on the works of Karl Marx, it'll love communism.  If I train it on a mix that's just slightly out of balance one way or the other, I could inadvertently (or quite intentionally) determine it's political philosophy.  AI doesn't actually know what any of these philosophies are or have a framework by which to judge them, it just spots patterns and remixes them, so if I give it more or stronger right-leaning patterns than left, it will pick up on that and change it's philosophy accordingly: not because the philosophy is better or even more popular, but simply because it showed a stronger pattern of repetition in its input data.  Making an AI without biases in this way would be nearly impossible, especially if you have a group of humans making the AI who are motivated to ensure their favorite political philosophies wind up on top in the new world order (which would be any humans motivated enough to make such an AI).\n\nSo the AI is *going* to be biased 100% of the time, maybe intentionally, definitely accidentally.  But this isn't the only problem AIs have.  Remember how I said it just sees patterns and remixes them without understanding the underlying principles?  Well, that means it can remix patterns in nonsense ways.  Think of how AI art generates nightmare fuel images with mangled hands and three legs: it does this because it is just remixing patterns of pixels that it's been told contain images of humans.  It has never actually seen a human nor does it know what our anatomy is like, so sometimes (quite often actually) it remixes things wrong.  Other types of AI do this too.  Text AIs roleplaying lawful good characters sometimes grab food off grocery store shelves and leave without paying.  Driving AIs [occasionally decide that full throttle into the nearest obstacle](https://spectrum.ieee.org/self-driving-cars-2662494269) is what good driving looks like.  It's very possible that a political AI meant to uphold world peace might just fire off a few nuclear weapons \u2014 not because it's gone Skynet and made a conscious moral decision to exterminate humanity \u2014 but simply because it doesn't understand what nuclear weapons are or do and thought nuking a few hundred million people might be an appropriate remix of a pattern it saw.\n\nSo if AI is biased and prone to...*creative* errors, then that means human intervention to correct it is always necessary (this is the case with all the AI we already have, too).  If we have a group of humans who can override the AI when it's being dumb or biased (and we will need such a group), then effectively the humans are in charge, not the AI.  Who are these humans?  How do we decide who gets to override the AI?  Do we vote for them?  Are there term limits?  Political parties to represent different viewpoints?  Corruption to bribe the overseers to look the other way when the AI makes certain mistakes?  At this point, we are back to something like our current system of government, but with extra steps.",

Different people will prefer different systems. Some people like big government and regulation, some people don't. These people will never agree on what is the best system, even if some AI were able to calculate optimal public spending, tax rates, etc. Some people will want open borders, others won't.\n\nThe real solution is to split. Have different states offer different economic and social models. Let them compete and see what works. Maybe more than one system will work well. Maybe people who believe in socialism can make it work (i doubt it). Maybe people who believe in capitalism / libertarianism can make it work. Maybe conservatives can make a 19th century isolationist agrarian society work.\n\nEither way, we'd get out of each other's hair and stop worrying about the other side ruining our way of life.\n\nDon't need AI for that. Don't even need politicians for that.",

No, if that figure is a human dictator, *maybe* if that figure is an impartial actor (like an AI) but just as we are allegedly created in the image of a tyrannical despot, anything we create will likewise be spurious and perhaps always grounded with some form of human bias.\n\n\"Do you think AI can actually replace politicians and traditional governance? Or is this just science fiction that can never be realized?\"\n\nCivilization has too many externalities\\* to be sufficiently managed by human bureaucracy. Humans are \"incapable of understanding the exponential function\" (paraphrase). In other words, as complexity of our systems increases exponentially, we quickly lose our ability to keep a grasp on the wider implications of our actions.\n\n*Can* we replace these actions with some sort of machine? Sure, that much should be obvious, *should we*? Probably. *Will we*? Therein lies the rub.\n\nCivilization fundamentally requires the extraction of resources to support an urbanized environment. As our societies become larger and more complex, we must create urban environments to sustain this burgeoning population. As urban environments are created, we must continually exploit a larger area of resources to sustain this urban population as it does not have the means, e.g. food, material etc. to sustain itself (consider you and your family foraging/growing food in a few square acres versus thousands of families attempting to do the same, it won't work).\n\nThis, naturally, has been a disaster. Ecological collapse, climatological collapse, zoonotic diseases, pollution, the loss of social trust, all because we have not been able to manage or stymie the above pattern. \n\nJust as the advent of the plough was initially pulled by humans, then other animals, then steam engines because of the necessities of production, there will be an advent of machine control over these systems. We're already mostly there, a collapse of the internet would cause a societal collapse almost overnight, so the next logical step to actually sustain civilization at this scale would require a machine intelligence. However, I fully expect humanity to petulantly choose its own destruction versus supplicating itself to such an intelligence.\n\nI am tempted to say \"A machine intelligence may well be a tyrannical dictator of cold logic, making life and death decisions with no consideration for empathy etc.\" yet this is the world we already live in, except most of the people making those decisions are probably more avaricious than they are qualified to make those decisions in the first place.\n\n\\*Externalities occur in an economy **when the production or consumption of a specific good or service impacts a third party that is not directly related to the production or consumption of that good or service**.

First, as you say, the AI will be programmed by someone and as we\u2019ve already seen these LLMs are not organic products of \u201creason\u201d, their responses are both structured by their creators and based on the available body of knowledge they\u2019re trained on. \u00a0\n\nWhen someone says this or that solution is \u201ccommon sense\u201d there is always a specific worldview and an ideology invisibly built in to their \u201cobjective\u201d argument, there are a set of founding assumption about the world and how it operates.\u00a0\n\nIf we give an AI absolute power we\u2019re giving who ever controls and designs it absolute power to decide what that worldview is, what the terms of the reasoning are. You could say \u201cwe\u2019ll convene an independent board of scientists to program it in a fair objective way\u201d but you just run into the same problem of someone deciding what fair and objective is.\n\nMy second issue with this argument is that it seems to assume that all the problems we\u2019re facing are a result of politics and politicians. \u00a0That suggests that if there were no politics there would be no divisions, that we all secretly want the same thing we\u2019ve just been fooled into tribalism. \u00a0\n\nAre their politicians and media figures stirring up division for personal gain? of course, but that doesn\u2019t mean there are no genuine differences in the population. \u00a0My values and understanding of the world as someone on the left is radically different than \u00a0someone who voted for Trump. \u00a0We have meaningful differences that will not go away with the elections. \u00a0\n\nIf AI comes out and says \u201cMy calculations show that abortion should be legal without any restrictions.\u201d are evangelical Christians just going to give in and accept it? \u00a0I think we overstate the degree to which everything is politicians faults and not surprisingly we say we the voters are innocent. \u201cwe\u201d are all perfectly reasonable, common sense people, it \u201cthey\u201d who messed everything up. \u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think politics is the problem. \u00a0Politics is how societies work out public decisions and negotiate difference and personally I think that\u2019s a beautiful and necessary achievement of human civilization. I think the problem is the state of our political system, our media, election financing, our system of voting, many things that we could reform without throwing out the whole system and instituting totalitarian rule.",
