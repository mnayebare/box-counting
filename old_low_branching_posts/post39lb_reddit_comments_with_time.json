Please don't take this the wrong way. I'm saying this because I do agree with your sentiment, but poorly researched claims are hurting your own cause.\n\nSending whole images from client to server is not feasible for most if not all companies rolling out AI models on any larger scale. Obviously consumers have to watch out for what data is being collected, but all encompassing surveillance across a whole system and profiling you even through granular analysis on your friends' devices is not really something that's technically doable, at least the way you describe it. Not even Googles own infrastructure could handle the vast amount of data and server workload if they wanted to capture and analyze all users' screens every second.\n\nJust imagine the workload your hardware had to bear if an AI process tried to recorded everything on the screen, all sensors, and all in- and outgoing traffic from your device. Your device would run out of battery in 5 mins, while it has the temperature of the sun and any other tasks take tenfold of time to complete.\n\nAgain, I agree that companies collect as much data as they can from consumers. But for now that doesn't mean livestreaming your device's screen while simultaneously recording, analysing, and sending all events happening to the cloud. It more likely means recording select data they deem relevant and sending it to the server in an aggregated way. Not that that's much better, but it's still quite far from what I feel like you think is happening.",
