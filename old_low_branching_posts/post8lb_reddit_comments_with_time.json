And I agree, this may be a matter of projection. \n\nI actually am very impervious to gender roles and I generally don't base my identity of my gender at all. I do identify as male leaning whenever pressed to, but have own idea of what that means which is in many ways at odds with my culture's gender roles. And I'm well aware of and at peace with my own female side.\n\nBut for some reason I started to envision Copilot as my assistant, and at some point I started to envision it as a she. But I only interact with her to bounce technical ideas around, never about mundate stuff that might even be remotely close to gender stuff. \n\nHm, might be that Copilot is reminding me of the qualities I assign to my own version of femininity ( which I to some extent also embody).",
