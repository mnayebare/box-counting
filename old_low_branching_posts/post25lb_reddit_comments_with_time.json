Excellent choice for a paper! \n\n\nAll AI stems from algorithmic models, and there's a long history of bias in these systems. \n\nCheck out work by Helen Nissenbaum, Taina Bucher, Safiya Nobel, Abeba Birhane, Cathy O'Neil, Virginia Eubanks, Jenna Burrell, Marion Fourcade, Joy Buolamwini, Timnit Gebru, Emily Bender, Alex Hanna, and Danielle Citron.\n\n\nA good place to start is this review article about algorithms and Sociology: https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-090820-020800\n\nAlso Bernard Koch wrote a history of AIs development and how it's driven. I can't find it but if you email him he might give it to you. He presented it at ASA this past summer.",

The data used to train the\u00a0recruitment model\u00a0was informed by resume samples from a 10-year period, where women were underrepresented. The resume screening model thus used \u201clinguistic signals\u201d associated with successful male candidates.\n\nBasically because AI draws from the past to find patterns relevant to its programming, it's also drawing all the biases from the past. So if an AI program notices that women are not represented in the past hires, it doesn't understand the context as to why. It just assumes that women must not be good at the job and gives applications with male-sounding names more points automatically. This type of bias extends to things like race, language, etc.",

Humans draw conclusions from empirical data too, and the miasma model of bias is probably more accurate for human beings' reasoning than for machines'.",

This means that information, which Luhmann calls 'communication', does not flow freely between systems but is aprehended by each system and interpreted only with the elements that belong to the system in question. In the case of the subject, which he names the 'psychic system' it is closed to the 'social system', which permits Luhmann to focus mostly on the social system and avoid getting too involved in discussions of 'anthropological principles'. Therefore there can be no talk of the subject 'melting' into the machine or becoming engulfed in artificial intelligence or whatever. Hence why Esposito refers to it as 'artificial communication', it is something that exists mostly 'out there', in the social system.",
