                    "body": "I see no reason why there isn't enough wealth in this country to provide everyone with a basic level of housing, healthcare, education, and sustenance. Maybe not right this instant but if machines do end up taking over 90% of labor then there definitely will be. It's just a matter of distributing it. This doesn't necessarily \"cause inflation.\" Want more, work more seems fine to me. \n\nI really think that if we achieve a post-scarcity society, then we will need to think beyond capitalism since a lot of capitalist ideas simply won't apply or will cease to work. Say what you will about capitalism but I do not think it is some immutable natural law of human behavior. It is an ideology, a system, that works given a certain set of constraints like the ones we have on earth today.\n\nI think you can envision all of the \"UBI housing\" as futuristic projects/slums full of shitty people, but those places are called \"traps\" for a reason. If everyone has the resources to move freely, no good, rational person would choose to continue living in a trap/hood/project/ghetto/slum. People would likely self-organize into like-minded communities (kinda how they do on facebook/reddit, now there's a scary thought with it's own set of issues). If you get a \"bad apple\" that moves into your community there can be democratic processes to remove them, or you can move yourself away. Like how mods ban trolls. Holy fuck the more I think about this, it might actually be scarier than the Dredd version of the future. Everyone lives in their idyllic echo-chamber safe-space bubbles and if you don't fit in you get kicked out by a futuristic HOA. Lol. Now THAT could be a good black mirror episode.\n\nWhy do you assume early hyper-specialization? Machines are *great* at being hyperspecialized, and humans are better at generalized problem-solving and big-picture thinking. Why would you need to start studying to be a doctor at age 7 when there is a specialized machine that can do 90% of every routine surgery there is? Instead humans will need to take a more generalized, integrative approach to learning. Then as a doctor, you will be spending your time thinking about how you can get a machine to do a rare or specialized technique that there isn't already a machine for, or solving more systemic issues that bleed over into other disciplines, like how epidemiology has strong social, psychological, and cultural factors, and how you might approach those to reduce suffering. Things that are strictly human in nature, things that require wrestling with human value systems.\n\nI definitely think that during the TRANSITIONAL period there may be a hyper-stratification of society into the rich elites and a huge underclass of poor. Whether that is a stable state for society depends on how truly well-suited UBI is to satiating human needs and desires.",

With UBI, there would definitely be two very distinct classes of people, those with jobs, and those without. On the flip side, it would be *way* easier for someone to look into getting the necessary training for whatever job they might want, if they don't have to juggle that against their obligations of an existing job if they don't want to starve!",

Commercial space travel will follow the path of commercial air travel, accessible because of the cargo network commercial passengers don't see. Every warehouse, dwelling, and powerplant built will need a drone operator, and teaching you how to use *this model* of drone will just be on the job training. \n\nHIghly paid people of the future will have developed skills in a particular industry. Drone operators with geology degrees who understand how to find good build sites. Architectural designers who understand exometorology well enough to incorporate those design features into the luxury housing market. (Luxury goods and services are usually safe.) Drone operators who understand logistics best practices to keep a warehouse with no human staff running. \n\nIt takes a while before technical capability becomes cheap enough to really compete with human labor. Sometimes, it's cheaper to pay 15 people to stare at a screen and push a button if \"something weird\" happens, and those jobs will always exist.\n\nFor those times when throwing cheap human labor at a problem is the most economical, we'll have apps and platforms that allow people to throw their labor into that pool on their own schedule. Rather than eating out at the end of a week, you might schedule a professional chef who specializes in your wife's favorite ethnic cuisine and it'll be as easy as getting an Uber.\n\nAI and robotics are just tools. Adapt and learn how to use them as they become relevant to your industry and you'll be fine. ",

Legislate maximum working hours down over time so that work must be shared around rather than horded. People have more free time. Study / further education becomes more of an option post age 21. Retiring at 40 to go back to University becomes a thing. More people studying helps science progress,etc,etc.\n\n3) Deniers.
