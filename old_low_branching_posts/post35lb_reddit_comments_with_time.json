Summaries without comprehension are inherently stupid, but it's especially stupid when analyzing  works that inherently require interpretation. I don't need a remixed average of every bad religious hot take on Reddit. \n\nSecondly, dumb AI bros' salesmanship aside, why would we even WANT to remove the experience of *seeking truth* from the human experience? This is like saying, \"I've created a robot that can automatically kiss all the girls you like. Think of all the time you'll save not worrying about kissing the girls!\"",

The mere idea of improving procedures is disconnected from what is going on in \"spirituality\". \n\n>AI-Powered Religious Text Analysis\n\nRegurgitation of existing intepretation is not a new interpretation. Repeating existing intepretation has zero spritual value as it's just data sliding down the chain of signifiers. Any possible benefit one can get from reading religious text is by DOING THEIR OWN INTEPRETATION COLOURED BY THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THEIR PERSONAL LIFE. Any interpretation that makes any sense is personal and connected to that exact moment in time. Getting AI chatbot to produce fortune cookies mantra out of religious texts will serve no one (except maybe fortune cookie conglomerate). \n\n>AI Chatbots for Spiritual Guidance\n\nGuidance can be inner or outer, in each way it can only be by understanding human condition and connecting this to an individual person. AI cannot understand human condition because ... it's not human. \n\nThis is basically creating generic therapists which is the dumbest thing ever as humans are kinda specific in their issues and problems. Might as well buy a self-help book instead. (I mean, it's still dumb, but at least it's low tech and has smaller carbon footprint)\n\n>AI-Generated Prayers and Sermons\n\nLord have mercy. \n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nIf prayer is not personal and it's not traditional, what is it good for? \n\nAI will do sermons? And this is good why? *\"Generic generic copypasta copypasta moralistic moralistic A-MEN\"*\n\nI mean if you want to maximise the feeling of alienation from organised religions, yeah, then AI is the way to go. \n\n>Virtual Religious Companions and Mentors\n\nAs above - if these don't understand how it is to be a human (\"human condition\") then what are they good for?\n\n>AI Image Recognition in Religious Studies\n\nYes, very crucial part of everyday religious practice. Especially in religions that forbade depiction of religious figure or divine entities. \n\n>Ethical AI and Religious Values\n\nLord have mercy. \n\n>Religious Education with AI Tutors\n\nFeed me generic refried articles o the exalted one!\n\nWhat's the use here? Any education here is linked to making personal sense of this - so either self education or education linked to a living mentor with ethics and hopefully wisdom. \n\nThis whole thing makes no sense - you're feeding generic garbage into something that needs specific wisdom connected to real life experiences\n\n>AI for Interfaith Dialogue and Peacebuilding\n\nDumbified translator tools will bring world peace? \n\nUhm. \n\nSure\n\nWhy don't you solve the middle east political situation first and then we'll see how it goes. \n\n>Challenges and Ethical Considerations of AI in Religion\n\n>While AI offers exciting possibilities in the realm of religion, it also raises significant ethical questions. Religious traditions often have nuanced beliefs, values, and rituals that are challenging for AI, which lacks subjective understanding, to interpret accurately. This limitation makes human oversight essential to ensure that AI applications in religious contexts remain respectful and true to core teachings.\n\nSolution - not use AIs in these areas. Problem solved. Then look at AI bros with deep deep \n\n>AI and religion may seem like an unusual combination, yet these intersections hold potential for deepening spiritual engagement, promoting interfaith understanding, and enhancing religious study. While AI cannot replace the human elements of belief, empathy, and community, it can serve as a valuable tool for those seeking to enrich their faith. By collaborating with religious scholars and leaders, developers can ensure that AI enhances, rather than detracts from, the spiritual experience. The future of AI in religious contexts will likely continue to blend technology with human wisdom, offering new pathways to connect with spirituality.\n\nWhat utter nonsensical garbage - did AI write that entire page? \n\nOf course it did. \ud83d\ude0f",

Hope they get paid a lot.\n\nbut let's see what MS edge pilot does with this\n\n*The convergence of AI and religion might appear unconventional, but it harbours the promise of enriching spiritual practices, fostering interfaith dialogue, and advancing theological education. Although AI cannot substitute the intrinsic human aspects of faith, compassion, and fellowship, it can be a significant asset for individuals aiming to deepen their religious experiences. Collaborations between AI developers and religious figures can guarantee that AI contributes positively to spiritual life. As we look ahead, AI's role in religion is poised to merge cutting-edge technology with age-old wisdom, creating novel avenues for spiritual exploration.*\n\nPretty close to original. Too close. \n\nHm, let's change tone to \"funny\"\n\n*Mixing AI with religion might sound like a techy joke, but it's no laughing matter when it comes to boosting spiritual mojo, bridging the gap between faiths, and giving religious education a high-tech makeover. AI isn't about to take over the pulpit, but it sure can lend a hand to those looking to spice up their spiritual life. Teaming up with the wise folks who know their scriptures, tech whizzes can make sure AI is the sidekick, not the star, of the divine show. As we march into the future, AI's role in religion is set to be less about silicon and more about soul, opening up brand new express lanes on the highway to higher connection.*\n\nWell THIS is how you sell BS folks! \ud83d\ude03",
