I applaud your courage.\n\nThis might help you for initial PoC:\n\nUse 2 SBC/camera systems, 1 regular and 1 \"ai vision\".\n\nThe regular camera system will be an \"on call\"-cam. It needs a endpoint/websocket to activate the stream on a specific client (your web-ui or local app ui).\n\nThen try to get some standard data for the ai vision -system. Make it detect an apple, and when it does so, task the \"on call\"-cam to do the websocket thing to your client. So every time the apple is displayed, the stream will be opened in your client.\n\nFinetune to a usable experience (what about multiple streams, closing it, applying follow-ups and some enterprise like users-system with rights/roles -structures.  \n  \nThen get it to work for non-apples. This will mean that you need to get loads of data. From my experience/knowledge (which is limited) it'll be way better to train a specific model per specific crime, and then apply the models at the same time (checking for their specific crime) on the same input-stream.\n\nif you come up with something that works, this would be the point where it would be wise to seek funding; I don't think a single engineer with limited time and budget will be able to achieve a production-grade system (within this niche) **and** is actually able to sell it.",

Prioritize encryption and decentralized data storage to keep sensitive information secure. Opt for user-controlled data retention and local processing of data by AI models for enhanced privacy protection. Open-source algorithms foster transparency and auditability. While challenges exist, designing AI surveillance systems with these features can help align technology with privacy concerns. Let's keep the conversation going on how to strike the right balance!",
