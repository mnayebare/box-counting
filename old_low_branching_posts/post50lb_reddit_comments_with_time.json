In an MCP configuration with LLMs you increase the likelihood of generating false output (this assumes you are using it for productivity rather than making things like art or a story)\n5. If you use your own data for this then you increase the risk of exposing your data to bad actors aince these agents have little means of actual controls to prevent attacks\n\n\nThere is more but for a general end user who looks to build personal workflows (aka... agents) these are the critical points.",

Many of those types of equations are repeatable and hence have a significant chance of looking accurate. When precision of any type is needed (wheher it is reseqrch or financial) and requires accuracy all the time then it is a prescriptive mathematical model that does it. LLMs in a multimodal configuartion gives the impression that they do do it but it offloads the calculation to an actual marhematical model (converts text to number,  calculates then returns the result as a text output to the calling LLM). My teams do it this way as we keep finding LLMs truly are bad at numbers and not reliable even for simple quoting tools.",

While doing this I\u2019ve thought about my children and how it will effect them and their futures. My two  daughter both work as nurses in the accident and emergency rooms at my local hospital and I am very proud of them, unfortunately neither of them have much computer knowledge apart from normal basics.\nThey both work over 60 hours a week and literally have no time to study or look into Ai. They were previously wanting to open an online store and sell products to make extra income for their families but just never had the time.\nWe live in the UK and because the economy is so bad at the moment and looking to get even worse I want to help them in any way I can. \nThey are looking to have a shop built that would 1.totally run it\u2019s self 24/7\n2.that could find high selling products on line\n3.advertise on the shop\n4.promote to Amazon, eBay, other platforms for the cheapest way but highest return\n5.postage cost calculators\n6.incorporate payments, \n7.security\n8. Anything else that\u2019s needed to build a successful self running profitable store that could bring in an extra income.\n\nIf it\u2019s not the thing for you any suggestions of people who could do it for me and costs it would be to make and monthly running costs for it?\n\nGreatly appreciate any help\nThank you",

If they\u2019re pro, they\u2019ll offer the most customization since they will build it from the ground up. Might take longer though.\u00a0\n\nGood luck!",
