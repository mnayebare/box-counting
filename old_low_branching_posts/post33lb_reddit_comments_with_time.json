And if one of the words in the verse has something like \"drowned, death, fire, hell\" it would throw me a red flag and I would have to explain myself to Open AI's feedback page.\n\nAnother example: one verse talked about how believing women should cover their hair and body when in public as a sign of modesty and so others will recognize them and they will not be hindred.  It **explained** the verse in a very **feminist**, everyone is equal, personal choice, etc type of way.\n\nAs far as finding connections.....yes but if you investigate them you will find the verses at times are not correctly listed (wrong verse) and it is limited in the scope of its reach.  HOWEVER it can at times describe things in a way I cant, for example if I type in \"explain the psychology or the state of mind that the prophet had according to that verse\"  it will do a good job.\n\nI am from Jerusalem originally and recently I have been researching the Quran.  I find that book to be the supreme and ultimate book of guidance from God.  The torah is nowhere to be found today, all we have is the talmud/tanakh and as far as the gospels/ the bible........there are over 1k different versions of that, and if I go to the original hebrew bible I find it to be simply a \"interpretation of an interpretation\".

The twist is that they might have a point. Any intelligence (AI or transhuman) which reaches the required levels of superhuman intellectual capability can extrapolate religious belief systems from simply observing the universe (even if Boxed from any information about other superintelligences, religion whatsoever, etc) and they all end up with the same thing. Humans aren't smart enough to draw or even understand the conclusions which lead to Enlightenment, but AIs can explain the basic rules and beliefs of their religion to us.\n\nA semi-related idea would be that the religion would consist of the AIs noticing that the world they inhabit follows the relevant narrative tropes and extrapolating that they're part of a fictitious work of scifi entertainment geared towards human-style minds.",

Artificial intelligence uses statistical models that provide a range of probabilities for different outcomes as opposed to offering a single definitive answer. This also has the implication of AI and natural language processing in its current state to be only as good as the data and the context it is trained on. If an AI system is trained on a dataset that primarily features one perspective or interpretation, it may struggle to identify other perspectives or interpretations.\n\nIf the data is skewed towards a particular interpretation or bias then the AI may replicate those biases and reinforce them.\n\nFurthermore, it's important to remember that even such \"objective\" algorithms would also fail to have a 100% success rate in interpreting text as intended. Natural language is intrinsically not an objective science and there will always be inherent challenges to achieving complete objectivity in natural language processing.\n\nAI might question some religious beliefs, but it's important to keep in mind that spirituality is personal and subjective. It can't be reduced to just an objective analysis. Instead of relying only on AI, we should approach these questions with an open and critical mind, talk to people with different perspectives, and try to understand the many aspects of spirituality.",

Your beliefs is your personal beliefs. But do understand  the question is centered on the affects of AI on religion  and such.

To this day, there are no satisfactory ways to do it.\n\nHow do you explain 34 trillion watts (other estimates 4 to 8 billion) of electromagnetic outburst in a matter of 40-billionth-of-a-second to form the image on the Shroud? This is not some loony ranting about his visions - this is a rigorous scientific study done by National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development/ENEA in 2011. Dead bodies certainly do not do anything like that...\n\nWhat I'm trying to suggest is that we're very prone to certain stereotypical thinking and many strong psychological biases - we accept things for their face value, often without making a thorough examination of the problem in question. And the problem is very often psychological, not with regards to the scientific data or facts.\n\nI'm well aware that the topic is about AI - what bothers me is the fact that our biases/stereotypes bleed very strongly into the system. For example, the stereotype that 'science and religion are incompatible', or that 'there's no God'. It just simply is not true. These are fundamental issues, that so many of science, esp. comp.sci people take too lightly.\n\nSorry if I sound rude.",

This speaks volumes about the level of your ability to do any relevant research...\n\nYou are correct about my level, but for the wrong reason. Truth be told I'm a STEM student doing research for my other classes apart from learning the basics of machine learning and artificial intelligence. So, I don't have the pleasure to spend all week, which in my early years I would spend hours each day learning different topics besides science. However, you could of helped not just me but anyone who was interested; you know how Google is sometimes if you don't spell the complete name of the person Google can give you the wrong person.\n\n\"How do you explain 34 trillion watts (other estimates 4 to 8 billion) of electromagnetic outburst in a matter of 40-billionth-of-a-second to form the image on the Shroud?

Dead bodies certainly do not do anything like that...\"\n\nCorrect again, dead bodies don't do that. But what make you think the  National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development/ENEA are specialized or have some authority on topic of archaeology/biblical antiquity. Was there a peer reviewed published article that I may read? \n\n\"What I'm trying to suggest is that we're very prone to certain stereotypical thinking and many strong psychological biases - we accept things for their face value, often without making a thorough examination of the problem in question. And the problem is very often psychological, not with regards to the scientific data or facts.\"\n\nVery true and you must make sure you also apply those standards to yourself as well or you risk becoming at bias in your investigation, or at worst a hypocrite to which no one should trust you anymore. As you stated the problem is often psychological, but I might add it is always accompanied by emotions as well and we often think too emotionally about many decisions. Regardless if they are big ones or small ones, that is why humans should reason. Because reason is indifferent to our human likes, our political affiliations, and our personal beliefs. \n\n\"I'm well aware that the topic is about AI - what bothers me is the fact that our biases/stereotypes bleed very strongly into the system. For example, the stereotype that 'science and religion are incompatible', or that 'there's no God'. It just simply is not true. These are fundamental issues, that so many of science, esp. comp.sci people take too lightly.\"\n\nI'm glad you are aware about human biases leaking into these machine learning algorithms. However, take into account that there are other biases that we as a civilization don't want our machines to learn for example racial inequality or unjust class discrimination. \n\nIf you will for a moment, I think it is to your benefit that these machines don't start learning to pick sides of religion. The \"stereotype that 'science and religion are incompatible', or that 'there's no God'. It just simply is not true.\" Is a very bad idea on your part. Let me explain: if we let these machine, especially large language models, learn 'science and religion are compatible' then the problem becomes a religious bias problem. Because the machine give more useful advice to certain kind of people and less accurate information or down right garbage to people with different faiths. This can spiral down to dangerous info hazard that can harm or kill innocent individuals on a large scale. So, at best I think you want to have these machines neutral when the subject of religion or God comes up. Plus it would not be fair to anyone, why x religion and not y, that sort of thing.\n\nIt's bad enough that the media gets into this area with the release of Chatgpt-4 and start saying a lot of things, a majority of which they don't have a clue what it means apart from looking cool when they say it and adding things that are flatly wrong.\n\n\"Sorry if I sound rude.\"\n\nNo you're not. You're just acting in accordance towards your nature. Your voicing something that you value as a human, I get it.",

Its about deciding to find companionship, and adding positivity where it does good.\n\n2:\n You could argue that having mistakes in there filters out the smart people, leaving the church, pope, etc to control their community more easily. This specific element is similar to pick up gurus, and other cults.\n\nSo having a version of religion that is factually correct would probably mean very little to religious folk, but would prove interesting in seeing what kinds of people it attracts.\n\nI'd also be very interested in a fusion of science and religion. Taking the positives from both.\n\nP.s. i am not religious",
