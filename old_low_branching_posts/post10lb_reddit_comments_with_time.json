I'm curious if places like this have plans to remediate the male hiring gender bias they'll have firmly ingrained in their work culture when STEM gender gaps level out, as they're slowly but steadily doing though.",

In some countries, less than 10 per cent of researchers are women. \n\nThey hold just 22 per cent of STEM jobs in G20 countries, and only one in 10 ascend to leadership positions.\"\n\nWhat do you want to bet it's filled with women who couldn't get jobs elsewhere?\n\nRegardless, I love this article. It reminds people that, no, DEI is not reverse discrimination. It can't be because, unlike what people are whining about, that facts say that women and minorities are still underrepresented pretty much everywhere that isn't minimum wage adjacent.",

Which is fine for now, but it's going to lead to a situation in another 10 years where the gender roles are completely reversed and only men will need to be hired in entry level positions, it's turned into a see saw situation. It's currently much easier for women to get stem jobs than men so I believe asking what policies institutes that are primarily hiring woman have to even things out in a few years when it's a woman dominated field is reasonable.",

As reported by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the national average turnover rate was 47.2% in 2021.\n\nYour whistleblowing on 'women taking over the workforce' isn't just bullshit, it exposed your fundamental biases. Maybe this is why you don't have a relationship. Studies say hard right conservatism is negatively associated with finding and keeping a partner in men.\n\nAnd for the record, people working on STEM fields consistently have lower unemployment rates and higher employment rates historically, by *wide margins* Maybe you should stop talking like men in these fields are suffering.",
