What is wrong and what is right and how to extract and label them correctly in semantic analysis? These are all actual and complex questions that computer science is trying to figure out with Natural Language Inference or NLI while training a model on different domains of knowledge. This topic is very heavily focused on the learning process of LLMs and inherently their transformers. Engineers try extremely hard to put restrains on the outputs, trying to prevent it from going to polarizing opinions, as all kinds of stuff can be learned from texts in datasets and corpora. This has nothing to do with the models fault. If you find my answer find to grasp, paste it into ChatGPT to extend my word for you. He will happily explain.

The oldest example in the books is that many of them will tell you that a man hitting a woman is never OK, whereas the opposite is sometimes OK.\n\nI don't think it's that clear whether this is being done deliberately.
