            "body": "In my opinion, asking Devs in the way that you are is likely the way towards biased results, simply because you're asking the question to the wrong crowd. \n\nIn industry, Responsible AI is often being driven by the research departments who help create the internal \"Responsible AI\" policies that then are enforced for development. \n\nSource: an AI researcher working in ethical AI and developing these policies\n\nETA: after reading the questions in your survey, I am reaffirmed in my earlier statement. You target people actively developing AI, but your questions cover the responsibilities of very different teams, including governance and management. Taking into account that much of the high level decision making that affects the topic in your survey is never actively discussed at implementation-team level, and that you are trying to correlate it with the diversity of the part of the team that is NOT making the decision, the outcome of this survey is unlikely to lead to any valuable insight. And I say this as someone working on the topic.\n\nBest of luck though.",
