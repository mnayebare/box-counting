They'll do the more time-consuming work of finding and collating the data, and then you can make the more important decision based on that data.  And importantly: you have the original sources to look up, so you can determine yourself whether any particular claim is factual or just a hallucination.\n\nTo quote the previous comment, this is exactly that sort of \"shrieking hot take\" that is addressing completely the wrong issue.  It's one thing to criticise the use of tools built by companies that have no respect for IP or authorship; or to be concerned about low-skill, entry-level jobs being the most likely to be replaced by these tools.  Those would be useful criticisms of what's going on.  But talking about these LLMs making their own decisions is simply incorrect.",

So many writers trying to cause as much chaos as possible. Every thing people do, even volunteers who are probably not the brightest, is the worst thing ever. Every person needs to be fired, every apology is insufficient, and how dare anyone do anything with current technology to streamline the process.\n\nNot that the organizers did a particularly great job using AI when most writers are flipping out on socials about AI. It might've been better to suggest publicly that one was going to try that with the subtext that these people are stretched thin and if you don't want AI you maybe should pitch in.\n\nI don't even really get the whole panel vetting process in the first place. Maybe it's because I'm a chemist and see how The American Chemical Society, for example, does conventions with no drama. When you register for WorldCon, check a box to answer the question \"Which is your favorite genre?\" and then have subcommittees form with those genres. Let them be loose, make it clear that they are arbitrary, only there to have subcommittees do the organizing. Use the head count to apportion out rooms and find people to lead the discussion of each event in each room. See how you don't need ChatGPT to do any of this? The people in charge of the subcommittee pick the heads of each panel who then pick all of the people on the panel, some database makes sure nobody picks the same person twice if that's not a good thing (which I would think it's fine but whatever). This process is simple and what everybody else does and so it is so weird that authors are so awful at all of this.",

Can't they not screw up for **one** year?\"\n\nBut even if there wasn't, \"because people weren't outraged about X, they cannot or should not be outraged by Y\" is not a logically sound argument.",

And I am not even on social media, other than Reddit, so imagine how much more problematic content there may be.  Using a LLM for the first pass, to flag panel applicants for further human review, seems like a great use of the technology.",
