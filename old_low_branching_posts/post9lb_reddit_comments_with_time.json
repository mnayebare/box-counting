Please elaborate on your experiences with changing it, has it positively changed your experiences with Google assistant, and have you incorporated it into your daily routine since then? \n\nAnd yeah, I should've been more careful with my wording - I don't really see it as a problem either but it's just this ongoing discourse that has been bought up frequently, especially right now with the emergence of AI chatbots (Snapchat's new AI feature). I appreciate your input about this though, thanks!",

            "body": "Hmm interesting, in short to answer your question I typically leave it at its default, I've played with the different voices and everywhere I have secondary voices usually aren't as pleasant or comprehensible as the default female voice.\n\n\nLONGER ANSWER: honestly never thought about it in a gender bias context, always assumed it had something to do with several factors like the female voice typically being clearer due to the lack of bass, possibly easier to modulate\n\n(voice assistants mainly came into play with telephone companies and banking institutions at a time when the speakers in phones struggled to produce much in the lower frequencies, and before they were recordings of real people they were modulated frequencies)\n\nthe female voice, but to speak to your idea of the possibility of gender bias, the female voice is typically perceived as more helpful than authoritative or intimidating and typically more calming than a male voice in a marketing sense these all make sense, people typically learn and function better when the environment isn't seen as hostile or involving the possibility of negative consequences. \n\nSo I guess depending on how you view gender bias who is the bias for and against in such a scenario? \n\nIs it biased towards females because that's the majority of voice assistants and against males because that's the minority? Or is it biased against females because of the patriarchal stereotypes of the way women are viewed in society and carried over in marketing?\n\nYou can see those same ideas present in different types of marketing media, want to sell a product and target the ideas of luxury, convenience and sex appeal? Have a female present it, want to sell a product and target the ideas of rugged, strong, and long lasting have a male present it. \n\nWant to teach kindness, humility, and acceptance in a workplace have a female present it, want to teach a safety topic that involves life or death for manual laborers, have a male present it. \n\nIndeed it seems you have a ton of research to do to report for or against the idea of gender bias in voice assistants. Let us know what you come up with, its definitely an interesting thought.",
